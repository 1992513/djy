It will be chaired by Fiona Bruce MP. Please see our press release below. -- The Conservative Party Human Rights Commission www.conservativehumanrights.com Press Release 27 June 2016 CHINA’S ORGAN HARVESTING TO BE FOCUS OF HEARING IN PARLIAMENT The Conservative Party Human Rights Commission is holding a hearing to examine the issue of organ harvesting in China, at 9a.m on Thursday 30 June in Committee Room 17, House of Commons. Journalist Ethan Gutmann and lawyer David Matas, co-authors of a major new report on the subject, will present evidence. Their report, Bloody Harvest/The Slaughter: An Update, was launched last week and they testified at a hearing in the United States Congress alongside the report’s other author, former Canadian member of parliament and government minister David Kilgour. Their report claims that forced organ harvesting – the forced removal of internal organs from live individuals, often prisoners of conscience, for sale, often to foreigners for transplants – is continuing on a massive scale. Victims of the practice include prisoners of conscience, particularly practitioners of Falun Gong, Uighur Muslims and other religious and ethnic minorities. Enver Tothi, a Uighur surgeon from China who has publicly admitted to carrying out one operation for the purpose of organ harvesting, will also testify to the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, along with Anastasia Lin, a Chinese-born Canadian actress and Miss World Canada, whose forthcoming film The Bleeding Edge highlights forced organ harvesting in China. The Conservative Party Human Rights Commission heard evidence on the subject of organ harvesting in its inquiry into human rights in China earlier this year, and its new report – The Darkest Moment: The Crackdown on Human Rights in China 2013-2016 – to be launched in Parliament on 28 June calls for further investigation into the issue. This hearing opens a new inquiry specifically into organ harvesting, which the Commission pledged in its report to conduct. The Commission urges the United Kingdom government and the international community to investigate the practice. Fiona Bruce MP, Chair of the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, said: “The evidence we heard in our hearings on China earlier this year, and the new report published this month by Ethan Gutmann, David Matas and David Kilgour, indicates a truly horrific, ghastly and harrowing practice of the forced extraction of organs from prisoners of conscience on a mass scale. So appalling is the scale and barbarity of this practice that we believe it is essential for policy-makers to examine the evidence further, to establish the facts, to develop better understanding and awareness, and to consider urgently policies which might address this. For those reasons we are holding this hearing, and will conduct further research in order to make our contribution to the efforts to highlight organ harvesting and proposals for action to end it.” For further information please contact Johnny Monro on johnny.monro@parliament.uk, or call the office of Fiona Bruce MP on 020 7 219 2969, or email Benedict Rogers on benrogers@csw.org.uk.

In 2015, Miss Lin won the Miss World Canada title, and was to represent Canada at the Miss World pageant in China. However, she was refused a visa and declared a persona non grata by Chinese authorities for her outspoken views on the country’s human rights violations and persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. The news of her rejection—and subsequent attempt to enter China—caused global media attention for weeks, leading to a front page article in The New York Times and op-eds in major newspapers. Since then, she has been invited to speak at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, the Oxford Union, and the Geneva Human Rights Summit at the UN, and has testified in the US Congress, the UK Parliament, and the Taiwanese Legislative Assembly.

Her films have received the Gabriel Award for Best Feature Film, the Mexico International Film Festival’s Golden Palm Award, and the California’s Indie Fest Award of Merit. Lin also won the Best Leading Actress in a TV Movie at the Leo Awards in 2016. As a model, she’s made appearances on runways around the world, including the New York Fashion Week show at the prestigious Waldorf-Astoria. Miss Lin has been listed as one of the “Top 25 under 25” by MTV, a “Top 60 under 30” by Flare, and called “The Badass Beauty Queen” by Marie Claire. She was one of eleven stakeholders selected to meet with Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird upon the establishment of Canada’s Office of Religious Freedom. Her articles have appeared in The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, The Globe and Mail, and other major newspapers. Enver Tohti Bughda was born in Hami (Qumul) city in Xinjiang China, and was brought up in Urumqi, the capital of Uyghur autonomous region. Upon graduating from Shihezi Medical University, he joined the Railway Central Hospital as a surgical oncologist. He worked in that capacity for over 13 years before leaving China for political reasons. After discovering the connection between the disproportionately high malignant tumour rate and the nuclear test in the Lupnur region in Tarim Basin, Xinjiang, with the help of a British film crew he exposed the devastating effect of nuclear test by making a documentary film about the test victims. As a result he was compelled to flee China and seek asylum in the UK. Upon acquiring political asylum and settling in London, through actively attending various international conferences and public discussion forums, he continued to promote knowledge about the shocking consequences of nuclear test in Lupnor (Luobopu) area, and fought for the rights of the test victims. He was also a political activist who campaigned for the human rights of the Uyghur people and, for number of years headed Uyghur political activities in the UK. In order to create a platform for an informed exchange of ideas he launched “Silk Road Dialogue”, an online platform. Years of public appearances and promoting Uyghur cause in the global stage has brought him international recognition as an expert speaker on the nuclear test issue in Xinjiang, China. Today, he is frequently being invited to present talks in important international conferences globally. He is not only a passionate advocate of Uyghur cause, but a qualified medical surgeon with first-hand information about the topic.

<p>在不眠不休连续几夜通读来自英国法轮功学员的举证材料之后，罗杰斯开始深入了解了法轮功。“法轮功被中共禁止的时候，我正在香港，那时还没有完全了解”，“现在我所了解的法轮功完全是平和的，贡献是正面的，因为我认为他完全注重道德和伦理，所呈现的完全是神性。”罗杰斯评价道。</p>
<p>罗杰斯从此更多的为那些因为不放弃信仰而一直受到中共打压迫害的法轮功功修炼团体公开发声。“我相信，Fiona Bruce 议员会继续敦促下议院进行辩论，谴责活摘器官。”罗杰斯说。</p>
<h2>用生命守护人权：这是我来世的目的</h2>
<p>在被问到为什么会选择为人权问题发声这个问题的时候，罗杰斯认为自己天生就应该从事这份职业：“我有一种很强烈的使命感，我感觉这就是我的天职，我的命运就是这样被安排的——有责任利用自由去帮助那些没有自由的人发声。”</p>
<figure id="attachment_9492615" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9492615" style="width: 439px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><ahref=" https://i.epochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2017/08/SG_EPT_BenRogers_07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <img class="wp-image-9492615 size-full" src="https://i.epochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2017/08/SG_EPT_BenRogers_07.jpg" alt="LONDON, UK, Thursday 22 June 2017.Ben Rogers at Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW) Office." width="439" b="658" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9492615" class="wp-caption-text">尼迪克·罗杰斯Benedict Rogers（Simon Gross/大纪元）</figcaption></figure>
<p>在几经生死的考验，出入东亚地区的时候，罗杰斯感到最欣慰的时候，就是与那些经历或正在经历苦难的人们面对面，了解他们的故事的时光。“我总能在他们身上寻找到让我坚持的力量， 他们展现了勇气、信念和坚忍不拔，即便经历痛苦。”罗杰斯面露喜悦的神色。</p>
<p>“在世界的各个角落，尤其是亚洲，仍然存在很多挑战。我必须坚持下去。”而罗杰斯的愿望就是“让世界不再需要这项工作 ”。</p>
<h2>人权：尊严的核心 人人需要为之贡献</h2>
<p>罗杰斯深信，不只是专职的人权活动家，每个人都可以为人权贡献自己的力量：“从一个让你关心的、特定的人权事件着手，之后联络当地的相关人权组织。” 对于那些希望更深入了解人权事务的人，罗杰斯建议首先要了解本国那些经历人权迫害的人，或者因为政治原因来本国避难的政治难民。“倾听他们的故事会成为维护人权的起始动机，并从中得到鼓励。”罗杰斯说。</p>
<p>有些中国人把维护人权与“爱国”对立起来，罗杰斯解释说人权是独立于政治之外的。“人权是普世价值，维权人士是维护人的基本尊严和简单自由，而这种基本尊严和简单自由是属于每一个人的。”</p>
<p>罗杰斯更希望中国人可以分清政党、政府和国家三者之间的区别：“政党、政府和国家，虽然经常交织在一起，但却是截然不同的概念”，罗杰斯说，“中国是一个充满潜力的世界大国，但是中国共产党只是一个并不真正关心国家和人民生活、腐朽和残暴的政权”。</p>
<p>罗杰斯还提到，中国的维权人士都是热爱中国、热爱中国文化的，他们维护的是世界上每一个人最基本的权利。因为每一个人，当然包括中国人在内都签署了《世界人权宣言》（Universal Declaration of Human Rights）。其第十八条的内容提到了思想自由、良知和宗教。 在不违反法律或没有实质性伤害他人的行为如恐怖袭击等的前提之下，每一个人有自由选择、而非强制性灌输他们自己信仰的权利。罗杰斯说，“宗教信仰自由是最基本的人权之一，是人尊严的核心。”</p>
<h2>维护人权道路艰辛 几经生死</h2>
<p>早前，从2000年起，罗杰斯走访缅甸与其边区四十余次，成为“不受缅甸政府欢迎列表”上的人物。曾经两度在缅甸境内被军政府遣返回国。</p>
<p>还有一次，罗杰斯在巴基斯坦首都伊斯坦堡的一家酒店开会，刚刚离开不久，这家酒店发生了爆炸。“我感到非常幸运可以逃过一劫，虽然这次爆炸并不针对我，”罗杰斯说，“但那颗炸弹时常提醒我，像巴基斯坦一样的国家中的人民，每天都在怎样过活。”</p>
<p>而罗杰斯有几位和他一样奔走在守护人权?阵线上的朋友们就没有那么幸运了。他们中有的已经遇刺身亡，另有几位还在冒着生命危险为人权伸张正义。</p>
<h2>缅甸男孩：“请告诉世界，不要忘记我们。”</h2>
<p>罗杰斯很多时间都穿梭在泰国的难民营以及缅甸边境的流放者聚集地。这些地方长年充斥着战争和冲突。“我在这些地方听到了许多非常感人的故事。”罗杰斯说。</p>

<p>2002年，罗杰斯在泰缅边境的收容所遇见了一位当时只有15岁的缅甸掸族小男孩。他的父亲在田里耕作时被缅甸国防军射杀，两周后国防军再度重返，不仅杀害了他的母亲，更火烧全村，毁灭了他的家园。小男孩被军队征作挑夫，随军队不眠不休行军三天，最后不支倒地。军队以为他死了，把他丢在路边，就这样，他逃过了一劫。苏醒后，男孩靠吃香蕉与树皮充饥，走出了丛林，逃出了缅甸。在遇见罗杰斯时，他说：</p>
<p>“请告诉全世界，对这个军事政权施压，要它不再杀害它的人民。请告诉全世界，不要忘了我们。”</p>
<p>罗杰斯在谈起这句话的时候仍然眼泛泪花。这句话一直激励他为人权发声。并促使和支持他完成被称为“最全面的缅甸现代史”的《缅甸：一个徬徨的国度》一书。</p>

<p>罗杰斯亲历现场，在被缅甸军政府重重管制下走访各地，以地毯式的田野采访，访问了政治犯与民运人士、人权义工、记者、英国外交官、受虐百姓、被迫从军的孩子兵、遭缅族军政府种族清洗的少数民族，以及昂山素季与其好友等人。将边境少数族群的悲惨命运和缅甸的民主运动交织在一起，生动有力的描述了缅甸人民的悲惨境遇 。</p>
