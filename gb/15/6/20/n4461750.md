<h2>九、犯人被警察恶行激怒</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>9. Prisoners Angered by the Guards’ Misdeeds</h2>
<p>2001年6月14日伤痕累累、下肢不灵便、尿已失禁的我和全身是伤的邹桂荣第二次被沈新教养院秘密押送到沈阳地下犯人医院，即沈阳监狱的犯人医院，那里关押的人除了法轮功学员是被非法劳教的，其他都不是被劳教的。<br />On June 14, 2001, for the second time, Zou Guirong and I were secretly escorted to Shenyang Underground Prison Hospital, also known as Shenyang Prison Hospital. At the time, Zhou’s whole body was covered with cuts and bruises, and I was riddled with scars, my lower limbs were immobile and I had urinary incontinence. In the hospital, only Falun Gong practitioners were illegally reeducated-through-labor, others were not subjected to labor.</p>

<p>这次的到来，吓坏了犯人们，因为我俩已没有了人形，管房的王大姐见到我们是又高兴又担心，叫人赶快给我腾出了个床铺，叫我快躺下。邹桂荣被分到了一号房。我不放心邹桂荣，管房王姐明白我的心意，就派人到那屋看看邹桂荣怎样。王姐告诉我，那屋的管房也给她腾出个床铺你放心吧。我对她流下了感谢而又感激的泪水。<br />Our arrival this time frightened the inmates because the two of us did not look human. The room-keeper, Ms. Wang, was happy to see us but also worried. She asked someone to hurry up to find a bed for me and asked me to lie down. Knowing I was concerned about Zou Guirong, who was assigned to a different Room, Ms. Wang sent people to find out how Zou was doing in her Room, and told me not to worry as Zou’s room-keeper also vacated a bed for her. I shed tears of gratitude.</p>
<p>我昏昏沉沉睡着了，等我醒来时，全身疼痛难忍，一个小个微胖的女人站在了我的床前问我：喂，“法轮”，（那里的犯人对法轮功学员的称呼）怎么了，说说你的案子让我听听，那时的我已经没有回答任何问题的能力了。王姐代我回答了一些她的问题。<br />I fell asleep warily. When I woke, I felt unbearable pain throughout my body. A small chubby woman standing next to my bed asked me, “Hey &#8220;Falun&#8221; [the term the inmates call Falun Gong practitioners] what’s wrong? Tell me what’s happened to you.” I had no strength to answer any questions at the time. Ms. Wang answered some questions for me.</p>
<p>第二天上午九点多，监狱的戴医生来到地下2号房，看一位癫痫病人，管房王大姐等戴医生问诊完，就跟医生说：我房昨天新来了一个“法轮”伤的挺重，你看看。那个戴医生没有回话就走了。管房王姐木讷了一会儿，对我说，你可要命大点啊，看样子你们“法轮”没有主治医生。<br />A little after 9a.m. the next morning, a prison doctor, Dr Dai, came to the underground No.2 Room to see an epilepsy patient. After Dr. Dai finished diagnosing, Ms. Wang asked him, “A new “Falun” arrived yesterday in my Room. She was injured badly, please take a look at her.” That doctor didn’t answer but left. Ms. Wang was silent for a while then said to me, “You need some luck. It seems like you &#8220;Falun&#8221; people won’t be allowed any doctors.”</p>
<p>

<p>我被灌食灌得鼻子、嘴、喉咙、食道胃都不行了。无法进食，王姐为了让我活命，就把自己的豆奶粉拿出来，冲好调凉后一点一点的喂我。每一次的吞咽我都痛苦无比。我看到王姐焦急的样子，就吃力地跟王姐说，王姐，唯一能救我活命的就是大法，你最好能把邹桂荣叫到我这里来，她能给我背法听是最好，因为那法是很超常的。王姐听了我的话，就到了一号房，跟那屋的管房说，我这屋里的“法轮”生活不能自理，没人照顾，让“法轮”他们自己照顾自己吧。就这样，我和邹桂荣除了睡觉又能在一起了。<br />From force-feeding, my nose, mouth, throat, esophagus and stomach were all failing, I was unable to eat. In order to keep me alive, Ms. Wang made soy milk with her own soy milk powder, and fed me little by little. Every swallow was very painful to me. I saw how anxious Wang was and said to her strenuously, “Ms. Wang, only Dafa could save me, it is best to have Zou Guirong here to recite Dafa aures to me, because Dafa is supernal.” After Wang heard what I said, she went to No.1 Room and said to the room-keeper, “The ‘Falun’ in my Room can not take care of herself, and there is no one to take care of her. Just let ‘Falun’ take care of each other.” So, Zou Guirong and I were able to be together again except when sleeping.</p>
<p>伤痕累累的邹桂荣见到我就喊我的名字：丽萍，丽萍，激动地哭着说，你咋样啊？我说，你给我背经文吧。她说，你要听经文啊？我说，你背给我听吧，我不会背。她想扶我坐起来，我没有坐起来。她坐到我的身边给我背经文，她会背40多首经文。王姐又找来了纸和笔让邹桂荣把能背的都写下来，她说她也要看看。<br />Zou Guirong was scarred when she saw me. She repeated my name. “Liping, Liping,” she cried agitatedly and asked, “Are you alright?” I told her to recite Dafa aures to me. She asked, “You want to listen to Dafa aures?” I said, “I can’t recite the aures. You recite them for me.” She tried helping me to sit up, but I couldn&#8217;t. She sat down beside me and recited Dafa aures for me. She could recite more than 40 Dafa aures. Ms. Wang found pens and paper to take down what Zou recited, and said she wanted to read it too.</p>
<p>慢慢的我能坐起来了，一点点能下地炼功了。<br />I was able to sit up slowly, and little by little I could even get out of bed and do Dafa exercises.</p>
<p>我们房间里10多人每天大量的听邹桂荣在背大法经文，在学炼功，那个矮胖女人她是邹桂荣那个房间的，她每天都到这个房跟着学炼功。有一天她跟我要我家的电话号，我也没问为什么，她也没说，我就给了她。后来在没有人注意的时候她对我说，法轮，你记住，只要我能出去，我第一个电话打的就是这个号。她把我家的电话号码记在了她的脑子里。<br />There were more than ten people in our Room listening to Zou reciting Dafa Scriptures and watching us doing Dafa exercises every day. The short chubby woman in Zou’s Room also came to our Room to do the exercises with us. One day, she asked for my home phone number. I gave it to her without asking why, and she didn’t say why either. Later on she said to me when others were not watching, “’Falun’, remember, if I get out, this will be the first number I call.” She kept my home phone number in her head.</p>
<p>（注：后来在我们生命攸关的关键时刻，她神奇的被释放了，她的案子是涉嫌倒卖杜冷丁。她完成了她的诺言，回到家就给我的妈妈打了电话。她在沈阳接待了我的妈妈和孩子，还大胆的跟着我的母亲与监管医院理论。请我的妈妈和孩子吃饭，还帮我妈妈付了打车的钱。我一直想感谢这个人，可是我一直都不知她现在在哪里，如果她能有缘看到这篇文章，就请她接受我的谢意，非常感谢你当年的正义所为，谢谢你！）<br />(Note: At a key moment when our lives were at stake later, she was magically freed. Her case involved the use of dolantin. She went home and called my mother as she said she would. She met my mother and child in Shenyang, and together with my mother, they boldly argued the facts with the Prison Hospital.. She took my mother and child out to eat and even paid for the taxi fare. I always wanted to thank this person but I don’t know her whereabouts now. If she reads this article, I would like her to accept my appreciation. I want to thank her for her just act. Thank you!）</p>
<p>一个多星期后的一天，管房王姐被狱警叫了出去，那时气氛凸显紧张了；中午王姐回来了，跟我说：狱警给我们管房的开会了，让我们看着你们“法轮”，不让你们炼功，如果发现有谁炼功，就让我们报告狱警，给你们铐起来，挺吓人的，你说这可咋办？我说：“我被非法关押一年半多来，遭了无数的罪，你已经看到了，现在我没吃一片药，也没打一针，用炼功来调整我们被残害的身体，你说这法超常不，你看到没有，那你说我能不炼吗？”他们不让我们炼功又不给我们医治，这不明摆着让我们死吗？<br />After about a week, my room-keeper, Ms. Wang, was summoned by the prison guard. The atmosphere was intense at the time. Wang returned at noon and said to me, “The prison guard held a meeting for room-keepers. They asked us to make sure you ‘Falun’ people do not practice Dafa exercises. Whoever is found doing the exercises should be reported to the prison guard to have them tied up. It sounded frightening, what do you think should be done?” I said, “In more than one and a half years’ imprisonment, I’ve met with numerous sufferings. You must have noticed that I havn’t taken a single pill or any injection. We use the practice of Dafa exercises to heal our damaged bodies. Can’t you tell this is extraordinary? And can’t you tell we can’t give up practicing it? If they don&#8217;t let us practice Dafa exercises nor do they provide us with medical treatment. Isn’t this a clear indication that they want us to die?”</p>
<p>管房王姐马上明白我的意思，然后对着全室里十多人说：今天监管医院给我们两个房的管房开会说，不许“法轮”在这里炼功，如果谁发现、谁就自己去报告，会有减期的机会。然后狱警会把他们铐起来。他们如果被铐起来，生活不能自理了，谁报告的谁就负责照顾她们，接屎接尿，听到没有，警察问你们可别说我没有告诉你们。<br />The room-keeper Ms. Wang immediately understood what I meant, and then said to more than ten people in the Room, “Today the Prison Hospital held a meeting for the room-keepers of the two Rooms. No ‘Falun’ was to practice exercises here. Whoever discovers this happening should report it. It will be an opportunity to reduce your prison term. Then the prison guard will cuff these ‘Falun’ who practiced the exercises. Once cuffed, they will not be able to take care of themselves – whoever reported them would be responsible for taking care of them, picking up their discharges. Listen up, if you are asked, don’t say that I didn’t tell you about it.”</p>
<p>我像往常一样照常炼功，管房王姐见我炼功就收拾收拾钻到了被窝里，然后对所有人说：我现在睡觉了，我可什么都没有看到，听懂了吗？她的话音刚落，所有人都停下了手里的东西，吃零食的也不吃了，闲聊的也不聊了，另一个房间的犯人也赶快离开了。她们陆续的都钻到被窝里去了，另一个房不知情况的走进来，见我炼功也马上跑回去了。<br />I practiced Dafa exercises as usual. Whenever Wang saw me practicing, she would just pack up her blanket and said to everyone, “I am going to sleep. I won’t be able to see anything, do you understand?” As soon as she finished talking, everyone dropped what they were doing, stopped eating snacks, stopped chatting, and the inmates from the other Room also left quickly. They all went to bed, hiding under blankets. When someone who didn’t know about the situation walked in, upon seeing that I was practicing the exercises, she would run back quickly.</p>
<p>每天我的功都是这样炼完的，中年女警官从来就不到犯人的病房，因为这里骚臭味道，熏人。一天她突然的进到我住的2号房，警告我不许炼功。然后抽调犯人出去了解我是否炼功，我房所有人都说没有看到过我炼功。<br />I completed the exercises this way every day. The middle-aged female prison guard had never come to inmates’ Rooms before because of the stinky smell here. One day, she suddenly showed up in No.2 Room where I lived to warn me not to practice the exercises. Then randomly picked inmates to question if I had practiced exercises, everyone in my Room said that they didn’t see me doing the exercises.</p>
<p>我还活着，我还能下地了，还能走几步了，这位女狱警，她是不相信犯人的话的，因为她知道我们法轮功在这里是没有医生给医治的，没有医生给我们问诊的，没有任何生活用品的，我们是奄奄一息被抬到这里来的。我们还活着，向她证实了法轮大法的超常。（年近七旬的法轮功学员李素珍阿姨帮助我们提供了一些生活用品，我们非常的感激这位老人家。）<br />Since I was still alive – I could even get off the bed and was able to walk a few steps – this female prison guard didn’t believe what the inmates said. Because she knew there was no doctor treating us, the Falun Gong practitioners, no doctors were diagnosing us, no daily supplies came for us, and we were all carried here on the verge of death, our being alive proved to her that Falun Dafa was superior to normal things. (Falun Gong practitioner Li Suzhen, close to 70 years old, helped provide us with some daily supplies. We were very grateful to this elderly fellow practitioner.)</p>
<p>不知是什么时间，法轮功学员周艳波也被沈新送到监管医院来了，法轮功学员赵素环被沈新送来不到两天就被带回去了。沈阳市第五看守所又送来了法轮功学员李素珍，沈阳市看守所送来了法轮功学员王杰，王杰被抬来时瘦的没了人形。新城子公安局送来了一个叫吕国芹的法轮功学员，这时监管医院里，法轮功学员先后共有六七人在这里。<br />I don’t know when but Falun Gong practitioner Zhou Yanbo was sent to the Prison Hospital by Shenxin Labor Camp; and Falun Gong practitioner Zhao Suhuan was sent back to Shenxin within two days; Shenyang City No.5 Detention Center sent Falun Gong practitioner Li Suzhen here; Shenyang City Detention Center also sent Falun Gong practitioner Wang Jie who was carried here because she was so thin and didn’t look human; and Xinchengzi Public Security Bureau sent Falun Gong practitioner Lu Guoqin here. At that time, there were a total of six or seven Falun Gong practitioners in the Prison Hospital.</p>
<p>我和李素珍阿姨在二号房，邹桂荣、周艳波、吕国芹住一号房。王杰、赵素环住走廊。一号房的管房叫王素玲、杨恕、申福实。她们几个人为了表现自己，不让法轮功学员炼功，她们管房24小时分班看着法轮功学员炼功。一天邹桂荣坐起来炼静功时，被杨恕一拳打倒，邹桂荣的头撞在了铁管子上。当时邹桂荣休克五分钟之多。然后王素玲、申福实叫来了狱警，狱警拿来了手铐把邹桂荣铐在了走廊的床上。（因为走廊有监控，王杰调进了一号房）我房里的犯人急忙跑过来跟我说这事。<br />Li Suzhen and I were in No.2 Room, Zou Guirong, Zhou Yanbo and Lu Guoqin in No.1 Room, and Wang Jie and Zhao Suhuan lived in the corridor. The room-keepers of No.1 Room were Wang Suling, Yang Shu, and Shen Fushi. In order to show off their power, they didn’t allow Falun Gong practitioners to practice Dafa exercises, but took turns to watch practitioners 24 hours a day. One day Zou Guirong was sitting up to meditate (the fifth Dafa exercise). She was knocked down by room-keeper Yang Shu from the sitting stance causing her head to collide with an iron pipe. She passed out for five minutes. Then the other two room-keepers, Wang Suling and Shen Fushi, called the prison guard. The guard cuffed Zou on the bed in the corridor because the corridor was monitored. To make space for Zou who was previously in No.1 Room, Wang Jie was transferred to No.1 Room. The inmates in my Room ran over to tell me about it.</p>
<p>当我见到邹桂荣时，她的脸就像发烧一样的红肿，嘴里不觉的会流出口水，头抬不起来，昏昏迷迷的，吃不下东西。<br />When I saw Zou Guirong, her face was as swollen red as if she had a fever, her mouth salivated continuously, she couldn’t lift her head up, was in a drowsy stupor, couldn’t eat.</p>
<p>我们几个法轮功学员向管房的王大姐报告，要求管房向监管医院领导反映，我们法轮功学员要求监管医院给邹桂荣医疗鉴定，我们要起诉追究这起伤害罪的责任人。<br />Several of us (Falun Gong practitioners) reported to the room-keeper Ms. Wang asking her to report our requests to the upper level leaders of the Prison Hospital. Our requests were to have a medical evaluation of Zou, and to bring a lawsuit against whoever was responsible for the assault.</p>
<p>监管医院听到我们法轮功学员的报告，怕承担责任，就要求沈新教养院来人解决问题。几天后，沈新来了四个狱警，三女一男（男的是往禁闭室送我妈妈饺子的那个，女的有院长助理邓阳）把我先找到提审室谈话，他们手里拿着一个表和笔，问我是否还炼法轮功，看样子是想让我填表，炼或不炼。我说；请你们弄清楚我的案子，我是被冤判“扰乱公共秩序罪”进来的，你的问题跟我的案子有关吗？如果你们谁说有，那你就写下来，签上你的名字，给我留个证据，以后等我活着出去告你们好用。<br />The Prison Hospital heard our report requesting Shenxin Labor Camp to solve the problem and take responsibility for the consequences. A few days later, Shenxin Labor Camp sent four prison guards, three women and a man (the man was the one who brought my mother’s dumplings to me in my Room, one of the females was Deng Yang, the director assistant of Shenxin Labor Camp.) They talked to me first in an interrogation room. Holding a pen and a form, they asked if I was till practicing Dafa exercises. It looked like they wanted me to fill the form indicating whether I was practicing or not. I said, “Please listen to my case first. I am here because of the unjust conviction of &#8220;disturbing public order.&#8221; Is your question related to my case? Whoever says yes, write it down and sign your name for me to keep. If I get out alive later, I could use it as evidence to sue you.”</p>
<p>他们叫人把我带了回去。又把邹桂荣提了出去，邹桂荣被提出去不一会儿，就听到邹桂荣惨烈的叫声：“警察打人了，警察打人了”，喊声断断续续不断。听到喊声，两室的犯人能起来的都跑到了铁栏杆门前观看，我和王姐、周艳波和其他犯人们焦急的摇撼着铁门喊“警察打人了”，对着走廊王姐就大声的喊：沈新教养院警察也太倡狂了，打人打到医院来了，原来电视说的都是假的。那个矮胖跟我要电话号码的妇女，不停的在走廊里大声的喊；警察打法轮了，警察打法轮了，法轮被警察打了，快来看啊。另一个胖妇女大声喊，监管医院为什么让警察到这里打人。这回我们可知道电视说的都是假的了，警察到这里打人监管医院管不管。<br />They asked people to take me away and bring in Zou Guirong. We soon heard Zou’s tragic cry: “Guards are beating me, guards are beating me,” the cry was intermittent and just kept on going. Inmates from both Rooms all ran to the steel bar door to look. Ms. Wang, Zhou Yanbo, some other inmates and I shook the steel door anxiously and shouted “Guards are beating people.” Ms. Wang called out loudly toward the corridor, “Shenxin Labor Camp police are too reckless, even beating people here in the Hospital. What was said on TV was all false.” That short chubby woman who asked for my home telephone number kept on shouting in the corridor, “Guards are beating ‘Falun,’ guards are beating ‘Falun’! ‘Falun’ are being beaten by guards! Come quickly and witness this!” Another chubby woman shouted, “Why is the Prison Hospital letting Shenxin Labor Camp guards beat people here in the Hospital? We know now that what was said on TV was all false! Is the Prison Hospital going to take charge and stop Shenxin Labot Camp guards beating people here or not?”</p>
<p>监管医院的门卫就这样被喊过来了，进到提审室说几句话就出来了。他刚一走，就又听到邹桂荣凄惨的叫声，铁栏杆里的女犯人们这回就更愤怒了，就又一次的集体呐喊沈新教养院的警察到监管医院打人了，警察执法犯法，电视说的都是假的。男病号的犯人们听到喊声，就手拿小镜子，把手伸到铁门小窗外，用镜子反光照想看个究竟。<br />The Prison Hospital’s gate-guard came because of our shouting but went right out of the interrogation room after saying just a few words. As soon as he left, we heard Zou’s miserable cry again. The inmates behind the steel bar door became angrier and shouted together that Shenxin Labor Camp guards came to Prison Hospital to beat people, violated the law while enforcing it, what was said on TV was all false. Inmates in male Rooms heard the shouting and pushed their arms, with little mirrors in their hands, outside the steel bar windows to look at the reflections in the mirrors to know what was going on.</p>
<p>这一次门卫惊慌快步跑过来，对着愤怒的女犯们吼叫，你们喊什么喊，不想活了，都给你们扣起来。随后就进去把邹桂荣带了出来。沈新教养院的四个警察随后就跟了出来，他们没有人敢看铁栏杆里那群愤怒的女犯们，低着头，快速的在女犯们的喊声中消失了。<br />This time, the gate-guard ran over quickly in a panic and yelled at the female inmates angrily: “What are you shouting about? How dare you! I will lock you up!” The four Shenxin guards came out with their heads low. Not one of them dared to look at the angry female inmates behind the steel bars. Then they left to the sound of female inmates shouting.</p>
<p>经过此事，女犯们在我的心里再也不是劳教犯人了，她们的灵魂在这次正义之举中升华得高尚，谱写了她们生命中最辉煌的一页。<br />After this happened, in my heart, female inmates were no longer inmates of reeducation-through-labor, their souls were made nobly sublime in this just act, writing the most brilliant page in their lives.</p>
<p>下面是邹桂荣笔下记录那时她在里面真实经过的片段，《我在马三家、张士、沈新、大北等邪恶场所历尽磨难不屈不挠》：<br />The following is some fragments of “Suffering Persecution at the Masanjia, Zhangshi, Shenxin, and Dabei Labor Camps” written by Zou Guirong, recording her real experience in the camps:</p>
<p>“一天，沈新教养院院长助理邓阳奉院长刘经（音）的指令，领着教养院的三个恶警：徐X、唐X、王X到地下监管医院，说是找我谈话，我被叫到女房外的一个屋子里，他们问我一些事情，并作了笔录，让我按手印。我看笔录不符合事实，于是我撕毁了笔录，他们火冒三丈，暴跳如雷，四恶警一起上来，把我按倒在沙发上，暴风雨的拳头急促砸在我头上，我大喊：‘警察打人了！警察打人了！警察打人执法犯法！’喊声惊动了女房里的尹丽萍、周艳波等人，她们跑向铁门，尹丽萍对我所在的屋子方向大声喊：‘沈新教养院打人了，沈新教养院警察打人了！’光光的门声使门卫赶向我的屋子并拧开门，四恶警立即停止对我的毒打，站起来好像什么事也没发生过一样，等门卫一走，两个恶警又上来强按我的手让我在另一份询问笔录上按手印，我不从，他们又要按我，我大声喊：‘警察强行逼供！警察强行逼供！’门卫警察听到喊声打开门不让我喊，我说：‘他们又打我，又逼我按手印，我不喊，他们还要继续折磨我。’门卫警察只好带我回女房，常人王姐说：‘沈新警察太倡狂了，打人打到医院来了。’女房人看到我颈部被抓挠出一道殷红的伤痕。当时我被四恶警打得晕头转向，不知道打哪儿了。”<br />“One day, Deng Yang, the director assistant of Shenxin Labor Camp, led three policemen, Xu, Tang, and Wang to the underground hospital on the orders of director Liu Jing; they wanted to talk to me. I was summoned from the women&#8217;s house and asked about some things. They recorded my answers and forced me to sign the record with my fingerprint. I saw the record was not accurate and tore it up. They were very angered by this, the four officers pushed me down on the sofa and beat my head viciously with their fists. I shouted, &#8220;Police are beating me! Police are beating me!! Police violate the law to beat people up!&#8221; My shouts shocked the practitioners in the women&#8217;s house. Yin Liping and Zhou Yanbo came towards the iron gate and shouted into the room, &#8220;Shenxin Labor Camp beats people, the police in Shenxin Labor Camp beat people!&#8221; Upon hearing the commotion at the gate the guards rushed to my room and opened the door. Those four police immediately stopped beating me and stood up as if nothing had happened. After the guards went away, two of the police forced me to put my fingerprint on an investigation record; they tried twice until I shouted, &#8220;Police interrogate me with force! Police interrogate me with force!&#8221; The guard opened the door and asked me not to shout. But I told him &#8220;They beat and forced me. If I didn&#8217;t speak out, they would torture me further.&#8221; The guard took me back to the women&#8217;s house. Sister Wang, a non-practitioner, said: &#8220;Shenxin police are crazy and even beat people up in the hospital.&#8221; The housemates saw a big red bruise on my neck. I had almost lost consciousness during the beating by the four policemen.”</p>
<p>邹桂荣出来后被打得晕头转向，她的嘴、脖子、脸都是伤痕，上半身几乎都是被抓挠的血道子。等她冷静一会儿才得知，沈新四个警察强迫她在“死也炼法轮功”的诱骗书上按手印。<br />After Zou Guirong was back from being beaten she was disoriented, her mouth, neck, and face were full of bruises, and her upper body was full of bloody scratch marks. She learned after she calmed down for a while that the four Shenxin guards had forced her to put her thumbprint on the deceptive &#8220;I would practice Falun Gong even though I died.”</p>
<p>邹桂荣因炼功被打伤的问题还没有解决，又被四名沈新教养院警察来监管医院打伤。监管医院又不管，法轮功学员和愤怒的女犯友们要求监管医院马上派医生给邹桂荣照相验伤，王大姐报告门卫说，沈新教养院到我们这里把人打伤，出人命这算谁的，快叫医生过来拍照看看吧。过了好一会儿那个姓代的老年男狱医来了，我们向他要求给邹桂荣头部拍片验伤，身上被抓挠的血道子希望监管医院给拍照下来。面对我们的要求，代医生向我们无奈地说：法轮功的事他说了不算。说完就走了。<br />Before the problem of being wounded for practicing Dafa exercises was resolved, Zou Guirong was beaten again in the Prison Hospital by the four guards from Shenxin. The Prison Hospital did nothing. Falun Gong practitioners and angry inmates requested the Monitoring Hospital to send doctors to examine Zou. Ms. Wang reported to the gate-guard that Shenxin Labor Camp came here to beat and wound people. “Who will be responsible if someone dies? Call the doctor here quickly to take pictures to examine.” After a while, that male physician Dr. Dai came. We asked him to take pictures of Zou’s head wounds and bloody scratch marks on her body. Addressing our request, Dr. Dai said to us helplessly, “About Falun Gong matters, what I say doesn’t count.” Then, he left.</p>
<p>我们又向监管医院反映了几次，没有任何回应。面对眼前这一切，大法弟子王杰（被中共这场迫害致死）、周艳波、邹桂荣，和我还有李素珍，吕国芹两位老年大法弟子，目目相对，我们的心此刻凝聚在了一起。看样子面对此事此刻绝食绝水是我们争取合法权利的唯一出路了。<br />We reported to the Prison Hospital several times with no response. Facing all this, Falun Gong practitioners Wang Jie (who later died from persecution), Zhou Yanbo, Zou Guirong, two elderly Dafa disciples Li Suzhen and Lu Guoqin, and I, looked at each other and with our hearts full, we all clung together. It looked like a hunger strike was the only way to strive for our legal rights at that moment.</p>
<p>监管医院面对我们的绝食先是无人理睬。没有人过问。<br />The way the Prison Hospital dealt with our hunger strike was to ignore us, no one cared.</p>
<p>李素珍阿姨，年已近七十，在她坚持绝食绝水一个星期左右身体突然出现不适，被她的办案单位接走了，后听说回家了。之后吕国芹阿姨也被办案单位接走了，监管医院里就剩下了我们四个：王杰、邹桂荣、周艳波和我。周艳波不知绝食了多少天，心跳和脉搏出现了异常，倒下了；王杰人瘦得脱了像，也倒下了，她们俩都被挂上了点滴。他们由监管医院的男犯杂役冒充护士天天给扎针。邹桂荣本来伤的就重昏昏沉沉的也倒了下来。<br />Li Suzhen, nearly 70 years old, suddenly appeared unwell after a week’s persistent hunger strike, and was picked up by the Unit in charge of her case. We heard she was sent back home later. After that, Lu Guoqin was also picked up by the Unit responsible for her. The four of us, Wang Jie, Zou Guirong, Zhou Yanbo, and I, were the only ones left in the Prison Hospital. After unknown days of hunger strike, Zhou Yanbo’s pulse and heartbeat appeared abnormal and she was faint. Wang Jie was very thin having lost a lot of weight and she was also faint. Both of them were given intravenous drips. The injections were administered by male inmates pretending to be nurses. Zou Guirong, already wounded, also collapsed in a stupor.</p>
<p>我在女犯友们的保护下，天天加强了背经文、炼功、发正念的时间和次数，因为这个缘故，即使在身体严重脱水、各脏器近衰竭的情况下，我的头脑还是异常的清醒。王杰告诉了我发正念的口诀，那口诀威力无比，我每天正念中清理了大量的邪恶生命与因素，清晰可见。<br />Under the protection of female inmate friends, I intensified the reciting of Dafa aures, practicing Dafa exercises, sending-forth-righteous-thoughts every day [a way of directing positive energy known to produce good outcomes]. Because of this, even when my body dehydrated severely and my organs were near failing, my mind was very clear. Wang Jie told me the verse of sending-forth-righteous-thoughts. It was immensely powerful. When I sent-forth-righteous-thoughts every day, it was clearly visible that I cleared up large amount of evil beings and elements.</p>
<p>我们绝食期间，跟我要电话号码的矮胖妇女不知什么时候被放出去了，我房又新进来一个家里很有钱的沈阳人，叫田某某，不知什么原因被王立军抓捕判10年，还不许她减刑。因为监管医院早已知道管房王姐维护我们，就让她俩一起管2号房，刚开始她对法轮功不太理解，只知道学法轮功的人都不坏。<br />During our hunger strike, I didn’t know that the short chubby woman who asked for my telephone number was released. A new one called Tian from a rich family in Shenyang was put in my Room. I didn’t know why she was arrested but Wang Lijun sentenced her to a ten year prison term and did not allow her mitigation to a lighter sentence. Because the Prison Hospital knew Ms. Wang had been protecting us, she was transferred to No.2 Room. At first, Tian didn’t understand Falun Gong well, only knew Falun Gong practitioners were all good people.</p>
<p>看到我们绝食，她不断的规劝，她的家里天天能送进来水果和很多好吃的，每天都会拿荔枝、西瓜等水果到我的面前，每次拿来，我每次都会给她讲我们绝食的原因，每次拿来，我都会给她讲我们法轮功被迫害的经历，她知道了真相，骂警察都不是人，没有人性，王立军更不是人，判她10年，还不许减刑。<br />〔注:王立军当时任辽宁省铁岭市公安局局长，田女士被捕后王立军与法官勾结判她十年刑。<br />王立军曾任辽宁省铁岭、锦州、重庆公安局局长等。自1999年中共迫害法轮功以来，王立军积极参与迫害，更直接参与了活摘法轮功学员器官与贩卖。请看追查迫害法轮功国际组织（World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong ）2012年2月16日发表之调查报告: http://www.zhuichaguoji.org/node/19592“锦州市公安局现场心理研究中心”涉嫌用法轮功学员做活人人体实验并活摘器官的调查报告〕<br />She kept on admonishing us for our hunger strike. Her family sent her fruits and other delicious food every day. She often brought lychee, watermelon, etc. to me but every time she brought food to me I would explain to her our reasons for the hunger strike, and every time I would tell her about our Falun Gong persecution experience. As she knew the truth, she condemned those police as inhumane, and she said Wang Lijun was even worse for sentencing her to ten years without the possibility of commutation.<br />〔Note: Wang Lijun was the director of Tieling Public Security Bureau in Liaoning Province at that time. Ms. Tian was arrested by Wang. Wang then colluded with the judge to sentence her ten years. <br />Wang Lijun had been actively involved in and directed suppression of Falun Gong practitioners in Tieling, Jinzhou,Chongqing where he served as director of the Public Security Bureau since the persecution began in 1999. Specifically, he participated in organ harvesting from living Falun Gong practitioners and organ trades. Please refer to the World Organization to Investigate the persecution of Falun Gong (WOIPFG) in a report on Feb. 15 : http://www.upholdjustice.org/node/214 Investigative Report: China’s Public Security Bureau’s On-site Psychology Research Center Implicated in Live Organ Harvesting on Falun Gong Practitioners〕</p>
<p>听杂役们讲，监管医院从来就没有做过猪肉豆角炖粉条的菜，这回打饭的男杂役，欢天喜地有节奏的敲着菜桶打着菜，边敲边吆喝着，猪肉豆角炖粉条了，每人一份，快来打，打晚了就没有了。肉香传遍整个走廊。女犯友们见到了荤腥，不舍的慢慢地品味着每一口菜。看到这一次次食欲的诱惑，我脑子里有过对食水的渴望。可是想到我们的责任，那一点点的欲望就必须得割舍掉。<br />We heard from male handymen that the Prison Hospital had never made pork, beans , vermicelli stew, but this time, the kitchen male odd-job workers happily drummed on vegetable barrows and vegetables and roared, “Pork! Beans! Vermicelli stew for everyone! Come quickly! Late comers might find there’s nothing left!” The meat aroma filled the entire corridor. Female inmates savored every mouthful slowly. Such temptation gave me a desire for food and water. But with the responsibilities we had taken on, I had to let go of that little desire.</p>
<p>我们四个法轮功学员的菜分给了犯友们，监管医院了解到我们无一人吃，对我们就一反常态了。<br />We four Falun Gong practitioners shared our portion of food with other friendly inmates. As the Prison Hospital saw that none of us ate anything, they completely changed their regular attitude toward us.</p>
<p>绝食到九天后，邹桂荣就被一群男杂役摁着强行扎点滴。因为我们长期被灌食身体都很糟糕了，这次是先打针了。<br />After nine days of hunger strike, Zou Guirong was pressed down by a group of odd-job workers who administered an intravenous drip. Because of long term forced-feeding, we were in real bad shape so they gave us shots first this time. </p>
<p>我们的集体绝食是要解决被非法关押到这里的种种问题，绝食到这份上监管医院没有一个人出来解决问题的。<br />Our collective hunger strike was meant to solve the problem of illegal detention here, but no one came to look at the problem.</p>

<p>邹桂荣不配合他们，就被男杂役拿来几十斤重，锈迹斑斑的脚镣子，两脚“丫”字型铐在床的两边，床单瞬间锈迹斑斑。双手被固定铐上动不了。邹桂荣反抗，男杂役就打她。这一切的发生吓坏了两个房间的女犯人们，因为她们还没有见过这场面。<br />Zou Guirong didn’t co-operate. The odd-job workers brought in more than ten kilograms of rusty leg-irons to put on her feet and tied her to two sides of the bed with her legs open in Y shape, the bed sheet was instantly stained with rust. They also cuffed her hands to immobilize her. Zou Guirong resisted, the odd-job workers beat her up. All this frightened inmates in the two Rooms because they had never seen this kind of persecution before.</p>
<p>两个房间的门都被男杂役们反锁上了，我焦急的在门缝里看着这一切。我拚命地晃动房门，喊着邹桂荣，呵斥着男杂役的粗鲁行为。<br />The doors of both rooms were locked by the male handymen from outside, I looked through the door gap anxiously, banged the door with all my might, called Zou&#8217;s name, and accused these male handymen of brutal behavior.</p>
<p><h2>十、放下生死　继续劝善</h2>
<h2>10. Let Go of Life and Death&#8211;Continue Encouraging Benevolence</h2>
<p>看到邹桂荣遭受的魔难，管房王姐和犯友们的恐惧，王杰、周艳波的昏迷，我冷静了下来。我预感到监管医院要对我俩下手了。我跟王姐要了纸和笔，用了不到两个小时的时间给监管医院的领导写了一封长长的信。<br />Seeing Zou Guirong’s suffering and the fear of Ms. Wang and the inmates, and as Wang Jie and Zhou Yanbo were in a coma, I became calm. I had a feeling that the Prison Hospital was going to do something to the two of us. I asked Ms. Wang for a pen and paper. In less than two hours, I wrote a long letter to the Dean of the Prison Hospital.</p>
<p>信中大意说：在法轮功的问题上，我们只是单纯的上访，为法轮功说句心里话。没有想到的是，我们莫名其妙的被判了个“扰乱公共秩序罪”劳教了。可是到了教养院就不提“扰乱公共秩序”了，跟我们大谈法轮功，转化法轮功。我们用生命鲜血和泪水谱写着每一天的劳教生活，见证了这场对法轮功迫害的邪恶与流氓，认清了中共是真正的邪教。六家教养院的迫害，把女人跟男人关押在一起，这无人性、血的见证，人的都不敢相信。超期的关押，无休无止的迫害。命在旦夕时，跟你们监管医院建立了这样特殊的关系。我不明白的是，我们法轮功跟你们监管医院无冤无仇，你们为什么智商如此的低下，非要充当那个人家牵的驴，你非要把那橛子拔下来的人？监管医院就这智商吗？你们以为我们会惧怕生死吗？你们认为我们的灵魂会放过每一个死不悔改、迫害死我们的人吗？监管医院如果执意要插进来这脚，趟这个浑水，那就冲我来吧，放了那三位母亲，谁家都有孩子。<br />The letter mainly addressed that, on the issue of Falun Gong, we simply wanted to tell what was in our hearts for Falun Gong. We did not believe we were guilty of the crime of &#8220;disturbing public order&#8221; for which we were sentenced to reeducation-through-labor. In the reeducation-through-labor camps, &#8220;disturbing public order&#8221; was never mentioned, but we were given a lot of talks about Falun Gong and about transforming Falun Gong. We lived every day of the reeducation-through-labor life through our blood and tears; witnessed the viciousness and scoundrels of the persecution of Falun Gong; clearly realized the true evil cult was the CCP. The bloody and inhumane experience in six labor camps; the imprisonment men of and women together; the extended detentions, and the endless persecution – no one would believe this kind of inhumane and bloody testimony. Upon dying, we had established some kind of special relationship with you, the Monitoring Hospital (Prison Hospital). What I didn’t understand was that Falun Gong people had no animosity towards the Prison Hospital so why were you so foolish as to pull the pegs after the CCP had stolen the donkey? [A Chinese saying that the one pulling the pegs – or stealing the post the donkey had been tied to – takes the blame for stealing the donkey.] Was this as high as the Monitoring Hospital’s intelligence went? Did you think we were afraid to die? Did you think our guardians would let off every one who would never repent, who persecuted us to death? If the Monitoring Hospital insisted on getting involved in this muddy water, just focus on me and let the other three mothers go, each one had children at home.</p>
<p>管房王姐和田某某看了我写的信都为我捏把汗，王姐报告了门卫把那封信交了上去，并嘱咐门卫狱警说，这是“法轮”给监管医院每个领导的，最好让院长看到。<br />Ms. Wang and Tian saw the letter I wrote and were very nervous for me. Wang reported to the gate-guard to have the letter submitted and said, “This was written by a ‘Falun’ to every leader of the Prison Hospital. It is best to let the Dean see it.”</p>
<p>王姐看到危险已向我走来，就急着要了我家的电话号码，给了当晚值班狱警好处，晚上她的姐姐来见她。王姐回来告诉我：她把我家电话号码给了她的姐姐，让她的姐姐先不要跑她的案子了，什么都别干，就接我妈，让我妈妈快来监管医院要人。活要见人，死要见尸。我听了这些话，不知要对这位大姐姐说什么好，两行感激的泪水再次无法止住。<br />As Ms. Wang saw the danger approaching me, she urgently asked for my home phone number. She sweetened the night shift guard to let her sister visit her that evening. When she came back from her sister’s visit, she told me she gave my phone number to her, and asked her sister to stop everything in hand to take my mother to the Monitoring Hospital to ask for me. If I was alive she should see me, if dead, she should see my corpse. When I heard what she said, I didn’t know what to say to her. Two streams of gratitude tears gushed down my face.</p>
<p>第二天上午10点多，监管医院终于来人了，监管医院中年女狱警站在走廊里，询问哪位“法轮功”是大学生？一号的管房说，我屋这两个，一个是护士，一个是单位的主持人，都不是大学。走廊里的邹桂荣是中专生，我住的2号房新来的管房田某某马上过来问我，“法轮”你是啥毕业？我说我是初中毕业。<br />By about 10am the next day, the Prison Hospital finally sent people over. A middle-aged female prison guard standing in the hallway asked which ‘Falun Gong’ was a college student. The room keeper of No.1 Room said there were two in the Room; one was a nurse, one was a unit host, neither one was a college student. Zou Guirong in the corridor was a technical secondary school student. The newly-arrived room-keeper of my No.2 Room, asked me, “ ‘Falun’, what school did you graduate from?” I said I was a junior high school graduate.</p>
<p>女警官见没找着大学生就又说：怎么有人敢写，没人敢承认了呢？这回王姐、田某某我们三个才明白，她是在找我。管房王姐说，你是在找她吗？那信是她写的，我报告了门卫，是门卫交上去的。然后王姐又问我，你没有写上你的名字吗？<br />Since they didn’t find a college student, the middle-aged female prison guard asked how come one had the guts to write but didn’t have the guts to admit it. Not until then, the three of us, Ms. Wang, Tian, and I, realized that she was looking for me. Ms. Wang asked, “Were you looking for her? It was she who wrote the letter, it was I who reported to the gate-guard, and it was the gate-guard who submitted the letter.” Then Ms. Wang turned to me and asked, “Didn’t you put your name on the letter?”</p>
<p>这个女警官进到了2号房，走到我的床前，我尽量的起身坐起来，我对她说了声你好！她见我的身体很虚弱，就让我躺下。她说，那封信是你写的吗？是你一个人写的吗？然后看看王姐，王姐向她点点头。我说是我写的，我们的经历已经超出了我所学的那点文化能表达清楚的了，是吗？我是倾尽了我的一切所学，向你们表达我们凄惨的遭遇。<br />This female guard walked in the No.2 Room in front of my bed. I tried hard to sit up to greet her. When she saw I was so weak, she asked me to lie down. She asked, “Did you write the letter? Did you write it alone?” She then looked at Ms. Wang. Wang nodded. I said, “I wrote it, but what we experienced exceeded the things my limited education could convey clearly, right? I exhausted all that I had learned to tell you our miserable experience.”</p>
<p>她说，你的信写的挺有力度啊，全院的领导都看了。她说；这是监狱医院，这里不许炼功。绝食就得灌，你们和办案单位之间的事，我们监管医院解决不了。我说，你们解决不了，那监管医院为什么配合沈新教养院到这里来打我们。她说不要用配合这个词。我说，那就用“允许”，为什么允许，你能解释吗？邹桂荣的身体被4个警察和一个犯人打伤在监管医院，我们要求拍片和照像，为什么这里没人管，这不是医院吗？这里强行灌食是你们的工作范围吗？我们愿意不吃饭吗？我们现在已经是超期关押在这里了。她说这个我不清楚，然后把两个房的管房的都叫了出去。<br />She said, “Your letter was quite powerful. All leaders of the hospital have read it.” She said, “This is a Prison Hospital. Practicing Dafa exercises is not allowed here. Whoever goes on hunger strike will be force fed. We cannot solve matters between you and the responsible unit.” I said, “If you can’t solve it, why collaborate with Shenxin Camp and let them beat us here?” She said not to use the word collaborate to which I replied, “I could use the word ‘allow,’ – could you explain why you allowed it? Zou Guirong was beaten by four guards and an inmate in the Hospital. We requested to film the scene but no one cared. Isn’t this a hospital? Is forced feeding part of your work here? Do you think that we wanted to stop eating? Our detention has already overrun.”. She said she wasn’t clear about that, and then called the two room-keepers to leave with her.</p>
<p>回来王姐偷偷告诉我，狱警给他们开会了，让她们配合看着你们给你们灌食。<br />Ms. Wang secretly told me when she returned that the prison guards held a meeting asking them to watch you and force-feed you.</p>
<p>第二天，监管医院就来了一群穿白大褂的男杂役，门卫让管房的把我看好。就先把我住的房门锁上了，然后门卫狱警把邹桂荣的手铐脚镣打开，又命两个男犯驾着，把她拖了出去。那时的邹桂荣已吐血多日。<br />The next day, a group of male handymen in white coats came to the Prison Hospital. The gate-guard asked the room-keeper to watch me. The gate-guard first locked the door of my Room, then unlocked Zou Guirong’s handcuffs and leg-irons and ordered two male inmates to carry her out. At the time, Zou Guirong had been spitting blood for several days. </p>
<p>下面是邹桂荣笔下记录的那次灌食经历，让我们重播一下。摘自《我在马三家、张士、沈新、大北等邪恶场所历尽磨难不屈不挠》：<br />The following is taken from “Suffering Persecution at the Masanjia, Zhangshi, Shenxin, and Dabei Labor Camps” written by Zou Guirong recorded the experience of the force feeding that time.</p>
<p>“男犯把我从床上拽下来，拖到灌食屋，他们把我撂倒在一条长椅上给我灌食，插了十几次管子也没插进去，都叫我把管子给吐出来了，他们有点急了，就把我按坐在靠墙边的一张椅子上，两个男犯一边一个死死的按着我的双臂，后脑杓被重重的顶着墙，继续给我灌食，插了十几次还是没有插进去，又叫我从嘴里吐出来了，气得男犯扯住我的头发使劲往墙上撞，坐着插不行，又把我拽倒在长椅上躺着，两腿被两个女犯压着，头发男犯按着，嘴被报纸和毛巾捂着，当它们还插不进去时，医院里一个护士朱姓老太太上前扇了我两个耳光，并用脚踹我的腿，咬牙切齿地对我说：‘我今天非得给你灌进去不可。我是法西斯，你是刘胡兰，我这法西斯就对付你这刘胡兰。’并恶毒攻击谩骂师父和大法，还说些低级下流的话，侮辱大法弟子，此时我已经身心交瘁，他们还是不放过，当我被插了三十多次管，历经两个小时的折磨，把我拖出灌食屋时，我已分不清东南西北。<br />“A male prisoner dragged me down from the bed to the feeding room, where they held me down on a long bench and inserted the feeding tube a dozen times, but I kept spitting out the tube. They became impatient, and pushed me into a chair by the wall, where one of two prisoners held my one arm, while the other pushed my head back against the wall to feed me but they still failed. This time, they became enraged and slammed my head into the wall by pulling my hair. They made me lay down on the chair because sitting didn&#8217;t work. Two female prisoners held my legs, a male prisoner grabbed my hair, my mouth was held open with newspaper and towels, but they still couldn&#8217;t do the feeding. An elderly nurse named Zhu slapped my ear and kicked my legs, then said with anger, &#8220;I will do whatever it takes to feed you today. I&#8217;m a fascist, you are Liu Hulan (a female hero in Chinese history); I am the right fascist to deal with you.&#8221; Meanwhile she slandered our teacher and Dafa, and said other indecent words to insult practitioners. At that time, my body and soul were extremely exhausted, but they didn&#8217;t let me go; instead they force-fed more than thirty times. This lasted for two hours. When I was dragged out of the room, I couldn&#8217;t tell where I was.</p>
<p>“我被拖回住的走廊时，呼吸已经困难，我在马三家教养院女二所被四个女恶警同时用四根电棍电，被邪悟的叛徒打得眼部充血，被打得大小便失禁，死去活来，被女恶警邱萍体罚五昼夜没让睡觉，连续五天五个半宿马步蹲桩，我也没有哭一声，可是这次我被法西斯折磨得痛苦不堪。（大北监狱地下监管医院就是被折磨致死的绝食女大法弟子孙宏艳备受折磨的地方。）<br />“I couldn&#8217;t breathe well after I was dragged back to the hallway where I stayed. I had been shocked with four batons by four female prison guards at the women&#8217;s second section in Masanjia Labor Camp, where I was beaten up by the collaborators until my eyes congested and I lost control of my bowels and bladder and nearly died. I was tortured by being deprived of sleep for five days by female police officer Qiu Ping and forced to squat down for five days and five and one-half nights and didn&#8217;t even cry. But this time I was so severely tortured that the pain is beyond words. (Sun Hongyan was tortured to death there at the Dabei Jail Underground Prison Hospital by force-feeding.)</p>
<p>“当晚，我被强迫打滴流，忽然感到胸口一阵痛，值班医生给我做心电图和胸透，心电图出现异常，胸透肺叶有大面积阴影，第二天复查，结果一样，医院不得不通知沈新教养院我的病危状况，此时我已吐血多日。”<br />“That night, I was forced to accept an injection and felt a sudden pain in my chest. The doctor on duty came to check my heart and chest. My heartbeat was abnormal and my lungs had darkened. The diagnosis of the next day showed the same result. The hospital had to notify Shenxin Labor Camp that I was in critical condition, at that time I have already been throwing up blood for many days.”</p>
<p>在我绝食到第十三天，那群白衣男杂役和门卫狱警拿着手铐，脚镣，走到了我的床前，两个男杂役刚要架起我，我就告诉他们，不要用那肮脏的黑手碰我。不然我就会撞死。门卫刚要强行弄我，王姐急忙过来说：她的腰可是折的，可别粘包。门卫狱警叫来了一号房的管房再加上王姐和田某某。她们五个把我拖到了灌食室。这里也有一群男杂役，和一个姓朱的老太太护士，还有一位不知名的女护士正在那里兑灌食的东西。<br />On the 13th day of my hunger strike, that group of white-coated handymen and gate-guards walked to my bedside holding handcuffs and shackles. Two male handymen were about to pick me up. I told them not to touch me with their dirty hands or I would throw myself against the wall and kill myself. As the gate-guards were going to take me forcibly, Ms. Wang hurried over and said, “Her back was broken. Do not make trouble for yourselves [should anything happen].” The door guard asked Ms. Wang, Tian , and the room-keepers of No.1 Room to come over. The five of them dragged me to the force-feeding room. There was a group of male handymen, an elderly nurse, Zhu, and another nurse, whose name I don’t know, preparing the force-feeding things.</p>
<p>他们把我强行摁倒在长条椅子上，我拚命地反抗。他们一群人摁着我全身所有部位，我的身体无法再动弹，我就感到马上要窒息了。一双黑手死死的摁住了我的头，一条罪恶的管子插进了我的鼻子。不知灌进去的是什么东西，我不停地呕吐。<br />They forced me down on a long bench, I tried to resist with all my strength. A bunch of them pressed down every part of my body, I was unable to move and felt suffocated. A pair of dirty hands held my head down hard, an evil tube was inserted into my nose pouring unknown things into me, I kept on vomiting.</p>
<p>我全身被灌得哪都是脏水，男杂役退了，我起身就向墙撞去。一群女犯们把我抱回了屋，我叫王姐把盆子给我拿来，我不停地呕吐，吐到胆汁都吐不出来为止。这一天我手脚都被扣上了。绝食的第14天的上午，他们那一伙又来给我灌食，他们刚一进我的房间就把那个癫痫病人吓抽了。一个医生赶紧赶来，一伙人忙活抢救她。医院见事不好，就在我被拉出去灌食前，就给那些血压高的、心脏病的都弄到一个室去。<br />There was filthy water all over my body for the force-feeding. When the male handymen left, I got up and ran into the wall. A group of female inmates carried me back to the room. I asked Ms. Wang for a washbowl and I kept on vomiting into it until I couldn’t even spit bile. My hands and feet were all cuffed that day. In the morning of the 14th day of my hunger strike, that same group came again to force feed me. An epilepsy patient had a seizure from fright as soon as they came in. A doctor came in a hurry along with a group of people busy working to save her. The Prison Hospital realized this wasn’t a good situation, they gathered patients with high blood pressure and heart decease and sent them to another room before dragging me out to force feed me.</p>
<p>我被架了出去。昨天那个医生正在配灌食的东西，我跟她说，今天咱们谁都不用麻烦了。请你们把你们的领导叫过来。我有话要对他说，要不然你们把我灌死你们还有责任。就这样他们找来了杨主任。杨主任个子不高，进到灌食室就跟我说，你有什么要求吗？我说是有要求，我说今天这食谁都不用麻烦了，就你一个人灌就行，我绝对的配合，绝不反抗。因为你们监管医院执意要插进来这只脚，非要拔那橛子不可，那我也没有办法，那你就亲自来灌吧。不知趣的朱姓老太太在一旁大声的骂师父，骂难听的话。我让她闭上那张臭嘴。她低着头跟着杨主任出去了。<br />I was carried out. The same doctor from the day before was preparing the force feeding stuff. I told her, “It’s a waste of time. Please ask your leader to be here. I have something to say to him, or else you must take the responsibility of force feeding me to death.” So they brought in Director Yang, not a very tall person. As he entered the force feeling room, he asked me if I had any request. I said, “I did have request. No one need bother today. You could do the force feeding alone. I will definitely cooperate, and will not resist. Because you, the Prison Hospital, insisted on getting involved and took the consequences. There is nothing I can do, just fed me yourself.” To one side, the stupid elderly woman Zhu swore at Dafa’s Master loudly with foul words. I asked her to shut her dirty mouth. Zhu left with her head down, following Director Yang.</p>
<p>不一会儿，给我灌食的那伙人接到一个电话都走了。食没有灌成，把我带了回去。<br />There was a phone call a little while later and they all left. After this unsuccessful forced feeding, I was taken back to my Room.</p>
<p>刚过下午，监管医院的院长（50左右男的）来到了我的病房，摸了摸我的脉搏，然后说，等一下沈阳法院的两个院长来看你们，请你配合一下，我们先给你挂一瓶点滴。然后你有什么话，什么冤屈你跟他讲。他见我明白他的意思，就吩咐房里的所有人看好我，别出事。<br />In the early afternoon, the Director of the Prison Hospital (a man about 50 years old) came to my ward, felt my pulse and said, “Two chief justices of Shenyang Court are coming to see you in a little while. Please cooperate with us. Let us hang an intravenous drip bottle for you. If you have anything to say, any grievances, you can tell them.” When he saw I understood what he said, he asked people in my Room to watch me closely not to cause any trouble.</p>
<p>我被狱医护士挂上了一瓶点滴，（不是男杂役）不一会儿，沈新教养院的院长助理邓阳和打邹桂荣的那几个警察都来到了地下监管医院。<br />A nurse (not a male handyman) of the Prison Hospital injected me with a bottle of intravenous drip. Soon after, Deng Yang, the assistant director of Shengxin Camp, and the guards that beat up Zou Guirong, and some police, all came to the underground Prison Hospital.</p>
<p>管房田某某上去接见回来告诉我，沈阳市看守所叫来了120车，抬着担架下来了。1号房一阵慌乱。昏迷不醒的王杰被抬了出去。<br />The room-keeper Tian told me, after going to the reception upstairs, that Shenyang Detention Center called an ambulance. A stretcher was carried down. No.1 Room was in a flurry. The unconscious Wang Jie was carried out on the stretcher.</p>
<p>王杰被送走后，邹桂荣突然又大口吐血。狱医赶快让杂役把邹桂荣背到上边去检查。回来后，邹桂荣不停地喘着粗气，昏迷了。医生下了药，杂役又把邹桂荣铐了起来。男杂役几次都扎不进去，找不到血管了，最后找来了监狱护士，护士也找不到血管了，最后就说要给邹桂荣的动脉割开。我躺在那里动不了，向王姐投去了求救的眼神。王姐马上对她们讲，把动脉割开那出人命算谁的。<br />After Wang Jie was carried away, Zou Guirong suddenly spit a big mouthful of blood. A prison doctor quickly asked a handyman to carry Zou upstairs on his back to be examined. After coming back down, Zou Guirong kept panting hard and then passed out. The doctor injected her with some kind of drugs and a handyman cuffed her again. Then a male handyman wanted to give Zou the injection but he couldn’t find her blood vessel to insert the needle. A prison nurse came later and couldn’t find her blood vessel either. Then they talked about cutting open Zou’s artery. As I was lying there unable to move, I used my eyesight to ask Ms. Wang for help. Wang immediately said to them, “Ripping up the arteries could cause death. Who would be responsible for that?”</p>
<p>我被女管房们抱到一个房间里，进屋的左边沙发上坐着沈新教养院的两个女警，其中有一个是院长的助理邓阳，前方的办公桌坐着两个沈阳市的法院院长，监管医院的院长叫我坐到沙发上，然后向我介绍那两个人，其中有一个姓张的院长。我向他们讲述了我们的被迫害的经历，然后说要起诉这些部门。那个胖院长说，这些警察的所为是违法的。你好好吃饭，回到沈新教养院好好养一养，然后你再写个起诉书。我说，我现在就是在非法超期关押。我看你这院长当得也不清醒了。<br />I was carried by female room-keepers to a room where two Shenxin Labor Camp female police were sitting on a sofa on the left side of the room. One of them was Director’s Assistant Deng Yang, and there were two Head Judges from Shenyang Court, sitting by a desk at the front. The Dean of the Prison Hospital asked me to sit on a sofa, and introduced me to the two Head Judges, one of them Zhang xx. I told them our experience of persecution, and said I wanted to sue those departments. The chubby Head Judge said, “The guards’ (police) act was illegal. You must eat well and rest well when you return to Shenxin Camp. Then you could write complaints. I said, “I am now illegally over-detained here past my term. I could see you were also not so clear minded as a Head Judge.”</p>
<p>我顺手拔下了那点滴的针头，药水血水淌到了地上。监管医院的院长马上喊来了人，把我抱了出去。这回他可真的怕充当那个拔橛子的了。<br />I pulled out the intravenous drip needle, potions and blood dripped on the floor. The Dean of the Prison Hospital immediately shouted for people to come and they carried me out. This time, he was truly afraid to take the fall, to be the one who pulled up the post after the donkey was stolen.</p>
<p>我被抱回去就什么都不知道了。不知什么时候，我脑子里看到一片金黄色，两条金色的金龙四目注视着我，飞舞着。旁边还有个天女在向我散花，不一会儿我又看到了高档的家俱，上面刻着龙和凤。那时的意识里我们已不知道我在哪边了。隐约间我听到田某某趴到我的耳边告诉我，杨主任让我偷偷的告诉你，你们三个“法轮”今天都回家。<br />I was carried back unconscious. I don’t know when but I saw a world of golden color in my head; two golden dragons flying sideways and looking at me; a goddess next to them scattering flowers on me. After a while, I saw a piece of very classy furniture carved with dragons and phoenixes. At that time in my consciousness I didn’t know where I was. I vaguely heard Tian lean forward close to my ear saying, “Director Yang asked me to tell you in secret that the three of you ‘Falun’ were all going home today.”</p>
<p>我的两个胳膊被手铐固定住了。两瓶点滴以最快的速度流进了我的血管里。我的胸膛像烈火一样燃烧，烧得我无法忍受。王姐见我折腾得难受就给我不停的用凉水擦身子，田某某把她那20多元的毛巾送给了我，然后对我说，你一定要活着，以后我家的生意一定让你帮着打理。她也亲手给我擦身子。最后我的胸膛就像要烧炸开了一样，昏迷中我在喊着“冰，冰，冰”。<br />My two arms were secured by handcuffs. Two bottles of intravenous drip flew into my veins at the fastest speed. My chest was unbearable, as hot as fire. Ms. Wang saw my suffering, she kept on using cold water to wipe my body; Tian gave me her 20-RMB-towel and said to me, you must live, I would like you to help my family business later. She also wiped my body. Finally my chest seemed like exploding, I yelled “Ice, ice, ice,” while in a stupor.</p>
<p>晚上六七点钟，监管医院来了最少二三十个男女警察。监管医院的院长再次来到我的床前，再次摸了我的脉搏。不知几瓶点滴下去，我平稳了很多。王姐含着眼泪守在我的身边，不再叫我“法轮”了，她说：丽萍啊，看样子你今天晚上就要回家了。你要挺到家啊。等我回家后一定到你家去，我大姐和你的妈妈已经处成好朋友了，她都去过你家了。我无力的点点头。<br />At about six or seven o’clock in the evening, 20 to 30 male and female police came to the Prison Hospital. The Dean of the Hospital came to my bedside and felt my pulse again. I lost count of how many bottles of intravenous drip were administered into my body. I was somewhat stabilized. Ms. Wang stayed by me in tears. No longer calling me ‘Falun,’ she said, “Liping, it looks like you are going home tonight, you must hold on to get home. I will definitely visit you after I am released. My sister and your mother are already good friends and she has visited your home.” I nodded feebly.</p>
<p>这时监管医院的杨主任叫管房的给我们三人收拾东西，给我们收拾收拾。王姐给我洗脸洗手时，我发现我手的五个指甲只剩下两个了，另外那三个手指没有了指甲，只有一层薄薄的透明肉皮。我的牙齿全都松动，头发全都白了，身上除了骨头没有一点肉。我13、14天没吃没喝又没死，成了监管医院的奇迹。周艳波先被背了出去，邹桂荣有护士跟着也被背了出去，就剩下了我。<br />At this time, the prison hospital Director Yang asked the room-keeper to pack up for the three of us. When Ms. Wang cleaned my face and hands, I discovered that, of my five fingers, only two had finger nails, the other three had only a thin layer of transparent skin on them. My teeth were all loose, hair white, and my body was so bonny there was barely any muscle. The fact that I was still alive after hunger strike for 13 to 14 days became a miracle in the Prison Hospital. Zhou Yanbo and Zou Guirong were carried out on carriers’ backs with only me left.</p>
<p>我望着帮助我的女同胞们，对她们说了声谢谢，然后把我还能用的东西分给了她们。面对王姐和田某某我不知说什么好，只有叮嘱她们记住“法轮大法好”，记住为了坚持宇宙真理不畏生死的我们。你们的正义相助将会记录在我们修炼的故事里面。我会记录下来留给后人看的。<br />I looked at the inmates who helped me pack. I said thanks with appreciation. Then I gave them my things that were still usable. As I turned to Ms. Wang and Tian, I didn’t know what to say. I could only remind them to remember that “Falun Dafa is good,” to remember those of us who adhered to the universal truth, unafraid of life or death. I told them their just assistance would be recorded in our cultivation stories. I would write it down for the future generation to read.</p>
<p>沈新教养院的邓阳和宋小石都来了，他们见了我，让人把我搀扶出去。当我走出铁门再回头看那一群同胞们。她们都哭了，王姐就在她们中。我无法止住泪水，含泪向她们告别。当我走到另一个铁门时。快看不到他们时，我意识到我将再也没有机会与这里的与每个人相遇，于是我停下了脚步，运了运气，然后我就掉转过头来，向监管医院的每个铁门里的生命喊出了我心中的叮嘱：你们一定要记住“法轮大法好”啊，“法轮大法好”……<br />Deng Yang and Song Xiaoshi of Shenxin Camp all came. When they saw me, they asked others to help me out. When I looked back as I walked out the iron door, they all cried, Ms. Wang was among them. I said goodbye to them in tears that I couldn’t hold back. When I came to the other iron door where I could hardly see them, I realized that I would never have the opportunity to see them again. I stopped, made a deep breath, turned my head and shouted to every life inside the iron door, “You must remember: Falun Dafa is good. Falun Dafa is good.” </p>
<p>邓阳说：法轮大法好，法轮大法好。你们几个可是生死之交啊，回去你们好好珍惜吧。这话从她的嘴里说出来，我感到有些吃惊。原来她不糊涂啊！<br />Deng Yang said, “Falun Dafa is good, Falun Dafa is good. You fellows were Damon and Pythias, cherish your friendship after getting home.” I was a bit surprised she said that. She was not confounded after all!</p>
<p>到了上面，我被架到了一辆高级的小轿车上，邹桂荣的车是辆面包车。她的车上配了七八个穿白大褂的男女警察。周艳波不知给送到了哪里。路灯下二三十个警察们在晃动着。我的车门突然被打开，一只手伸了进来，竖起了大拇指，然后低头看着我说：你真了不起，你给你们师父洗清了清白，如果法轮功都像你们这样，我们早解脱了。不一会儿，他又把手伸进来，这次是想与我握手，我把手伸给了他，他又说：江泽民没配，他完了。<br />As I came up to the ground floor, I was carried to a luxury car. Zou Guirong’s car was a van with seven or eight male and female police in white gowns in it. I didn’t know where Zhou Yanbo was sent to. 20 to 30 police were standing under the streetlights. Suddenly, my car door opened, a hand with thumb up reached in, then he lowered his head and said to me, “You are extraordinary. You have shown your master’s innocence. If all Falun Gong practitioners were like you, we would have been relieved.” After a while, he extended his hand in again, this time was to shake my hand, I gave him my hand, he said again, “Jiang Zemin cannot match you. He is finished.”</p>
<p>不一会儿，监管医院的院长也过来与我握手，告诉我多保重。司机和邓阳不知去办理什么去了，这会儿回来了，车就要开了。那个杨主任再次把手伸进来，与我重重的握了最后一次手说：请你多保重。邓阳说：你看我们警察对你都多好。我说，那是对正的生命的一种尊重，跟好没有关系。<br />After a while, the Dean of the Prison Hospital also came to shake my hand, asked me to take care. The driver and Director Yang went away to do something for a while and came back, the car was going to start. Director Yang once again extended his hand inside the car to shake my hand. After shaking my hand really hard for the last time he said, “Please take good care of yourself.” Deng Yang said, “Look how nice the guards were to you.” I said, “They were respecting a righteous life. It had nothing to do with niceness.”</p>
<p>一路上我的脑子里都是邹桂荣，不知她是否还能活着。邓阳怕我路上死掉，就拿来一瓶高档的饮料给我。我没有接受，她说，你喝吧，你喝了我们也会给你送到家的。我都不知道她说这句话是什么意思。后来才知道，周艳波在临走时喝了她们的一杯牛奶，当晚就没有放她，第二天她的家人交了三千元才放回。<br />All along the way, I was occupied by the thoughts of Zou Guirong. I didn’t know if she was still alive. Deng Yang was afraid that I might die on the way so she brought me a bottle of quality beverages. I didn’t accept it. She said, “Drink it. Even if you drink, we will still drive you home.” I didn&#8217;t know the meaning of what she said until later when I heard that Zhou Yanbo was not released that night after drinking a glass of milk that they offered. She was released the next day after her family paid them 3,000 RMB.</p>
<p>历经两个多小时的时间，也就是晚上10点多，我被沈新教养院偷偷地送回了家。到了家以后，邓阳就跟我家要住院费，我妈妈说；我的女儿是站着进去的，怎么躺着回来了呢？她原来体重有160，现在你们咋给整的光剩骨头没有肉了呢？你还跟我白呼（撒谎）啥呀。我女儿怎么跑到你们教养院去了呢？今天我告诉你们，我的女儿有个三长两短我就告你们去。<br />More than two hours after 10 pm, I was sent home secretly via Shenxin Labor Camp. After getting home, Deng Yang asked my family to pay for the Prison Hospital&#8217;s stay. My mother said, “My daughter went in standing, how come she came out lying down? She weighed 160. How did you fix it that she has no muscle only bones left? How dare you say anything to me? How did my daughter end up in your Camp? Today, I tell you, if my daughter dies I will sue you.” <br />邓阳见要钱无望就走了，他们的汽车消失在了黑夜中。<br />As Deng Yang realized it was hopeless to get money from my mom, he and the car disappeared into the night.</p>
<p>后记：我的妈妈在我绝食期间，接到了那个矮胖妇女的电话，然后我的妈妈又接到了王姐大姐的电话，那个矮胖妇女先到沈阳车站接到了我的妈妈，然后向我的妈妈介绍了我在地下监管医院的情况，打车领着我的妈妈和孩子到了监管医院要人。到了晚上，我的妈妈又给王姐的大姐打了电话，王大姐非常热情的接待了我的妈妈和孩子。后来这位王大姐就天天带着我的妈妈和孩子到各个公检法去告。<br />Posta: During my hunger strike, my mother received a phone call from that chubby woman, and then another phone call from Ms. Wang’s elder sister. That chubby woman went to meet my mother at Shenyang station. She described my situation in the underground Prison Hospital and called a taxi to take my mother and child to the Hospital to ask for me. That evening, my mother called Ms. Wang’s sister. She received my mother and child warmly. Later on, Ms. Wang’s sister took my mother and child to various Courts to make complaints.</p>
<p>王姐出来后就到了我家，在我家里跟我的妈妈讲了我被迫害的事，我妈妈才知道那么多我的事。王姐在我的家里用了两个小时的时间写下了《我在狱中见到的三十四位法轮功弟子》，那里记录了三十四位大法弟子永不磨灭的伟大瞬间。<br />Ms. Wang visited me after she came out of the Prison Hospital and told my mother how I was persecuted. Only then did my mother get to know what I encountered. Ms. Wang spent two hours in my home writing down “The 34 Falun Gong Practitioners I Met in the Prison” in which I have recorded the 34 Dafa disciples’ great moments that will not be obliterated with time.</p>
<p>因为家属被抓捕关押，心理压力承受到极限，没能及时写完这后续部分，很是抱歉。其实对我的迫害并没有因为我的释放而结束，之后还有两次被关马三家。以后我有时间还会写出后面的经历，还原历史，做一个人应该做的，不再麻木与消沉。<br />Because of the arrest and detention of family members, the psychological pressure on me has reached the limit, I am unable to complete the later part. I am very sorry. Actually, my persecution did not end after my release from the Prison Hospital. I was twice detained in Masanjia afterwards. I will find time to write what happened to me to complete this history and do what I should do. I will no longer be numb, and will no longer sink into depression.</p>
