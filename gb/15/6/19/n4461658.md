	<p>【大纪元2015年06月20日讯】</p>
<h2>五、马三家把我秘密的押到了黑男牢</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>5. Masanjia Secretly Imprisoned Me in a Dark Male Prison</h2>
<p>二零零一年四月十九日，结束了我在马三家七个月与魔鬼打交道的艰难岁月，这一天我一生都不会忘记。<br />My difficult seven months in Masanjia dealing with the devils ended on April 19, 2001, I will not forget this day for the whole of my life.</p>
<p>那天上午张秀荣点了我的名字让我收拾东西，我不知道全室三十人为什么让我一个人收拾东西并且连行李也要带上，正在疑惑，对面室的赵素环也被叫了出来，我们俩拿着行李被带到了院里，院里停着一辆大客车，很多男警察，这时各分队的队长也都出来了，恶警把平时被她们酷刑折磨没有“转化”的法轮功学员先后都带了出来，共十名。邹桂荣是最后被带出来的，因为那时她被单独关押。不知道哪一个队长说，这回给你们找个好地方，让你们好好炼。邹桂荣问：把我们送到哪里？没人再回答。<br />n the morning of that day, Zhang Xiurong called my name asking me to pack up my things. I didn’t know why I was the only one of the 30 in the room to pack up and to bring luggage. While wondering, Zhao Suhuan of the room across the hallway was also called, the two of us carrying luggage were taken to the courtyard where a bus was parking. There were many male guards. Then the Squad Captains also came out, and then the vicious guards brought out, one by one, Falun Gong practitioners who were not “transformed” under brutal torture, a total of ten. Zou Guirong was the last one out because she was confined separately. I didn&#8217;t know which Squad Captain said, “This time we’ve found a good place for you to practice, to enable you to practice well.”Zou asked, “Where were you taking us to?” No one answered.</p>
<p>临走时，我意识到我们不会再回来，我望着迫害我的两个队长，很想对她们说些什么。我还是鼓足了勇气走到了大队长王乃民的面前，眼含泪水跟她说，请你在法轮功的这件事上摆正与你工作的关系，善待法轮功学员。她的眼里没有了恶意，向我无奈的苦笑了一下。我又看了一眼张秀荣，脑海里浮现出她迫害我的一幕幕，她只比我小一岁，如果没有这场迫害发生，我们这个年龄应该是朋友才对。我心生悲怜，张开了那瘦弱的双臂走到她的面前拥抱了她，我小声的告诉她，你一定要学尖一点，这件事到最后会清算的，你不要参与。她突然也慌张的快速的对着我的耳边，非常小的声音对我说：“你有病，记住你有病，你有病”。当时我并不知道那句急迫的叮嘱是什么意思，但完全肯定那话没有一丝的恶意。后来才知道，她完全知道接下来我将被送到哪里，将会面临着什么。<br />Before leaving, I realized that we were not going to come back. I looked at the two Captains who tortured me and wanted very much to say something to them. I mustered up the courage walking to Captain Wang Naimin. I said in tears to her, &#8220;Please judge well between your work and matters of Falun Gong. Be kind to Falun Gong practitioners.&#8221; There was no malice in her eyes and she forced a smile at me helplessly. I took a look at Zhang Xiurong. The scenes of being persecuted by her appeared in my head one by one. She was one year younger than me. We could have been friends if the persecution had not happened. Sorrow and pity grew in my heart. I opened my thin and weak arms and walked over to her and hugged her. I whispered to her, &#8220;You must be a little sharper. There will be accounts to clear at the end of this matter. You should not participate in it.&#8221; She suddenly and rapidly whispered in my ear in fluster, &#8220;You&#8217;re sick, remember you&#8217;re sick, and you have illness.&#8221; I didn’t know what that urgent exhortation meant, but I was certain that there was not a shred of malice. Later on, I came to know that she knew where I was being taken to and what I would face.</p>
<p>我们十人（邹桂荣、赵素环、任冬梅、周艳波、王丽、王敏、王克一、曲姓阿姨等）被男警戴上了手铐押上了那辆大客车。车上放着几根大电棍，客车开到了男大队。两个男法轮功学员被几个男警察押上了这辆大客车上。其中一个男法轮功学员叫彭庚（已被中共邪党迫害致死），另一个不知姓名。<br />The ten of us (Zou Guirong, Zhao Suhuan, Ren Dongmei, Zhou Yanbo, Wang Li, Wang Min, Wang Keyi, an older woman Qu, etc) were handcuffed by male guards and boarded that big bus. There were a few electric batons on the bus and the bus drove to the male Brigade. Two male Falun Gong practitioners were escorted by male guards and boarded the bus. One of the male Falun Gong practitioner was Peng Geng (who was later persecuted to death by the sinful CCP), and the other one’s name I don’t know.</p>
<p>车突然停了，到了一所关押男犯的教养院，当时我并不知道那里是什么地方，后来在明慧网得知那是张士教养院，那里有专门迫害法轮功学员的黑监牢。对外就是张士劳教所。<br />The bus stopped suddenly, having arrived at a male Labor Camp. I didn’t know where this place was at the time but I learned later from Minghui.org that it was Zhangshi Labor Camp where there were black jails specifically for the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. To the outside, it was Zhangshi Labor and Reeducation Camp.</p>
<p>到了院子里，我们站了一排，我们的对面不知从哪里来了一群人也站了一排，两个膀大腰圆的男警察其中一个手里拿著名单点过我们的名后，他就开始念一份上面下达对我们不“转化”学员的宣告条例：对不“转化”的法轮功学员打死白打死，打死算自杀；还说了很多要命的话，现记不清了。这是江泽民的命令。另一个男警手拿电棍部署两个男犯给我们录影。<br />In the courtyard, we lined up. A group of people from somewhere else also lined up opposite us. One of two beefy guards held a name list. After the roll call, he started reading an ordinance fromhigher-up regarding practitioners who were not “transformed.” It read: “To practitioners not transformed: being beaten to death is death in vain as beating to death counts as suicide …”There were many other frightening words that I didn’t remember. This was Jiang Zemin&#8217;s order! The other guards holding electric batons deployed two male prisoners to film us. </p>
<p>彭庚和另一男法轮功被带走，我们十个被带到了男教所的小白楼。到了那个小白楼，我们每个人都被量了血压，其中一个曲姓的法轮功学员被带走了。那里剩下了我们九个。小白楼的门口是警察的值班室，值班室的旁边是铁栏杆门，铁栏杆门里面是一层厚厚的隔音铁门。<br />Peng Geng and another male Falun Gong practitioner were taken away. Then the ten of us were taken to a little white building of the male Squad. When we arrived, they took the blood pressure of every one of us. Falun Gong practitioner Qu was taken away, and the other nine of us remained there. At the front door of the little white building was the shift guard’s room. At its side was a iron-barred door,. Behind the iron-barred door was a door layered with very thick soundproofing.</p>
<p>我们九个被分别分到了九个房间。我被分到第一房间。房间里有一张大双人床，和一个木制落地衣架，四个男人早已等候在那里。我上厕所时看到一个大房间里至少躺着三十多个不同年龄的男人在睡觉。我有些害怕，不知道这是什么地方，他们是什么人，为什么这里有这么多的男人躺在地铺上睡觉，到了晚上有了答案。<br />The nine of us were dispatched to nine different rooms. I was assigned to the first one. In the room, was a large double bed and a wooden cloth stand. Four men were already in the room. When I went to the toilet, I saw more than 30 men of different ages sleeping in a large room. I was somewhat afraid as I didn&#8217;t know what this place was, who they were or why so many men were lying on the floor sleeping. I had the answer in the evening.</p>
<p>晚上十点多，我问一直呆在我房间里的中年男人，你们为什么不离开我的房间，我要睡觉，其中一个男的说：睡觉？你要睡觉？哈哈。这里不“转化”没有让睡觉的，有一个女的在这里“炼”到十八天都没睡觉，最后炼成了精神病。<br />At around 10pm, I asked the middle-aged men who had been in my room all along, “Why don&#8217;t you leave my room as I want to go to bed.” One of them said, “Sleep? You want to sleep? Haha! In here, no “transform” no sleep. There was a female here, “practiced” for 18 days, didn’t sleep, and finally became psychotic from practice.”</p>
<p>不一会儿，他们被换了班去睡觉了，又进来四、五个，不一会儿又进来一群，他们在走廊里大声喧哗，吵闹，砸门，不停的说着难听的话语，到我的屋里踹门而入，手拿录影机对着我就乱录，突然走廊里传来了邹桂荣凄惨的喊叫，她不停的喊着我的名字，“丽萍，丽萍，我们从狼窝又被马三家送到了虎穴，这个政府都在耍流氓 了!”<br />Shortly after that, they went to sleep and four or five others came, followed shortly by another group of people. They made a lot of loud noise banging doors, and kept on shouting dirty words, kicking open my room door and holding a camcorder taping me indiscriminately. Suddenly, I heard Zou Quigong’s tragic scream coming from the hallway. She kept on calling out my name, &#8220;Li–ping, Li-ping, we were sent from a wolf’s den to a tiger cave by Masanjia. This government is playing hoodlum!&#8221;</p>
<p>听到她凄惨的叫喊，我拚命的冲了出去。邹桂荣也拚命的冲到了走廊，我抱住邹桂荣死死的不撒手，看管我们的男犯不停的打我们，我拚命的护着瘦小的邹桂荣，我的右眼角骨被打凸起来，身上的衣服全被撕裂掉，裤子在脚面上，衣服在脖子下，几乎一丝不挂。我和邹桂荣都被拽回了房。他们四、五个男犯人把我扔到了床上，有摁胳膊，摁腿的，其中一个三十多岁的男人骑在了我身上打我(后来得知此人叫武传金，几年前已死于癌症)。我被打的晕头转向，终于躺在了床上。As I heard her dreadful cries, I rushed out with all my strength. Zou also rushed out to the hallway desperately. I held Zou and wouldn’t let go. The guards in charge kept on beating us. I risked my life to protect the little skinny Zou; the corner bone of my right eye bulged out from the beating; my clothes were all torn, my pants dropped onto my feet, my clothes fell from the neck, I was almost naked. Zou and I were dragged back to the room. Four or five male inmates threw me on the bed. Some pressed down my arms, some pressed down my legs. A man about thirty years oldsat on top of me and beat me(Later I learned that his name is Wu Chuanjin.He had died from cancer several years ago.). I was disoriented from the beating and finally passed out on the bed. </p>
<p>等我从昏迷中醒来时，我的身旁已经躺了三个男人，左边一个(武传金)，右边俩个，右边挨着我的男孩不停的在我的身体上乱摸，他的年龄还不到二十岁。他身后的那个男的手也不闲着；左边那个手脚都不老实，不停抓挠我的脸，用腿来回顶我的下身；我的头上方的地下也坐着一个，他的手不停的摸着我的头和脸，阴阳怪气的说着什么，我腿的间隙处还站着两个，一个在录影，一个站着看录影，嘴不停的说着脏话，脚下不知是几个，他们不停的抓挠我的脚心。嘴里不停的说着脏话和狂笑，还不停的说：你别装死啊，死了也得“转化”。<br />When I came to, three men were lying beside me: one on my left (Wu Chuanjin), two on my right. Of the two on my right, the one next to me kept on touching my body. He was merely a boy, less than twenty years old. The one next to him was also busy with his hands. The one on my left was dirty too. He kept on scratching my face with his hands and pushing my genitals with his leg. There was one sat on the floor above my head, his hands kept on feeling my head and face, and said obscene words with no relation to anything. There were two others standing between my legs; one videotaping, one watching; both kept on saying filthy words. There were a few standing below me scratching the bottom of my feet, laughing wildly while talking dirty; they kept on saying, “Don’t play dead. You’ll still have to “transform” even if you’re dead.”</p>
<p>我无法相信眼前这一幕，一口鲜血涌到嗓子眼。我的思维又一次的静止下来，床上，床下，床左，床右一切的一切喧嚣，好像离我是那么的远，那么的遥远。我的思维定格在了学校：从小学到初中老师们教我的爱祖国，爱党，爱人民，社会主义好，捡到一分钱要交给警察叔叔，这的一切一切的思维瞬间在我的脑海里浮现然后瞬间崩毁瓦解，脑子里出现了邪党的党旗，党旗在灰暗的空间飘荡着，一群幽灵在镰刀斧头下狂笑悠荡着。这一幕绝非形容，是那 时脑中真实所见。那个声称“伟大、光荣、正确”的党它原来如此的流氓。<br />I couldn&#8217;t believe what was happening. A mouthful of blood rushed to my throat. Once my thoughts calmed down, all clamor above, below, left and right of the bed seemed so far away from me, so distant. My thoughts fixed on schools, from elementary to high school, where teachers taught us to love our homeland, love the Party, love the people, socialism was good, turn in the money you found to the police uncle – all these thoughts flashed in my head, then crumbled instantly. Then the sinful Party’s flag appeared in my head; it was waving in a murky space, where a crowd of phantoms were swinging and laughing wildly. By no means am I just saying this, it is truly what I saw in my head. That so-called &#8220;great, glorious and correct&#8221; Party was actually such a villain.</p>
<p>我的耳朵从喧嚣杂乱中听到了邹桂荣凄惨的喊叫声，“丽萍!丽萍!”。我仿佛在梦里，不，不是梦，我确定那不是梦，这凄惨的叫声再次把我的思维带回了这可怕的人间地狱，我听不到了任何杂乱的声音，看不到任何事物，我拚命的起来在寻找那个熟悉的声音。我的头被门前守着的“魔鬼”用落地式衣挂砸中，我的头瞬间有一股热流流在了我的脸上，我拚命的站起，我的意识里再也没有了生死的概念。没有生命能阻挡我，我拚命的砸门，同时我的身体被拚命的砸着。我不停的呼喊邹桂荣的名字。邹桂荣冲到了我的房间，抱起我冲向了那罪恶的铁门。<br />In the midst of chaotic noise, I heard Zou Guirong’s tragic cries, &#8220;Li-ping!Li-ping! &#8221; It was as if I was in a dream, but no, it wasn’t a dream, I was certain it wasn’t a dream. This tragic cry again brought my thoughts back to this awful hell on earth. I couldn’t hear the chaotic noise around me, couldn’t see anything. I struggled to get up and look for that familiar voice. The &#8220;devil&#8221; door guard smashed my head with a free-standiong clothes rack. A stream of blood flowed down my face instantly. I struggled to stand up with no thoughts of life and death any more. Nobody could stop me. I charged into the door with my whole body desperately smashing into it. I kept on calling Zou’s name. She rushed to my room, picked me up, and dashed toward that sinful iron door.</p>
<p>我俩同时拚命的砸那铁门。铁门终于开了。我们俩已伤痕累累。面对警察我们已把生死置之度外，并质问他：这里是中国的劳教所吗？政府为什么对我们如此的耍流氓。你是否有母亲，有妻子，有姐妹，有七姑八姨。这里的一切流氓行为是否代表国家的行为。今天这些男人如果不离开我们的房间，我会记住今天，今天是二零零一年的四月十九日，是你在这天晚上值班，我们活着出去一定会告你，我们如果死在这里，我们的灵魂绝不会放过你。我们的忍耐绝不是无度。他听了我们的话，叫来了看管我们的男犯，告诉他们在他值班时不要叫这俩个人出事，让她俩今晚在一起，让她们睡觉。<br />The two of us together banged hard on that iron door. Finally the door opened. We both were already badly bruised. Facing the guard we had no concern for life or death anymore, and questioned him, &#8220;Is this the Labor Camp in China? Why does the government bully us this way? Don’t you have a mother, wife, sisters, and aunts? Is all this hooliganism here on behalf of the country? If these men don&#8217;t leave our room today, I will remember this day, and that today, April 19, 2001 you were on duty this evening. If we get out of here alive, I will sue you. If we die here, our souls will never let you off.&#8221; Our endurance by no means was unlimited. After he heard what I said, he summoned the male prisoners who watched us and told them to make sure we weren’t hurt, and to let us be together tonight, and sleep.</p>
<p>我们俩被带回了我住的房间。这回一切都消停了，房间里只留下了四个男人看管我们，我俩眼含热泪对视一夜没有合眼，走廊里不时传来别的房间敲门砸门嚎叫声。<br />We were taken back to my room. Everything calmed down. Only four males remained watching us. We looked at each other in tears and didn’t close our eyes the whole night. Every now and then, the noise of door knocking, smashing, and howling from other rooms reached in from the hallway.</p>
<p>四月二十日，警察交接班，邹桂荣被带回了房间，我看到一个管事的男犯手里拿着昨晚的记录在汇报。不一会儿昨晚那些“魔鬼”拿着录影机又到了我的房间，这回多了个女的，他们拿来了好多大法的书，他们读一段，按着他们的意思邪悟一段说给我听一段，然后其中昨晚骑在我身上打我的那个男的(武传金)见我不跟他们学，就从地上一把把我拽到床上打我，然后问我为啥不学了呢？你不是想学想炼吗？我说我没有犯罪，这里不是我学法的地方，我为什么要在这里学。为什么让人关起来学。他们把我说的每一句话都记录在一个本子上，然后让我看对不。到了吃饭的时候，面对这里的菜、饭，我再也吃不下了。身体虚弱的已不成样子。<br />On April 20, when the guards changed shift, Zou Guirong was taken back to the other room. I saw a male prisoner, a handy man, reporting with the minutes of last night in his hand. In a little while, the “devils” of last night came back to my room holding video recorders and accompanied by a woman carrying a lot of Dafa books. They read a section and explained it in an evilly twisted way to me. As they saw I refused to “learn” from them, the man, who sat on top of me and beat me the previous night(Wu Chuanjin), picked me up from the floor threw me on the bed and beat me, then asked me why I didn’t “learn”? “Don’t you want to learn and practice?” I said, “I had committed no crime, and this wasn’t the place for me to learn the Fa. Why would I want to learn here? Why imprison someone to learn?” They recorded in a notebook every word I said and showed it to me to see if it was correct. When we were having dinner, looking at the food, I could not eat it anymore. I was weak and exhausted.</p>
<p>到了晚上，昨夜那一幕再次上演，因为今晚值班警察换了，邹桂荣再次被追打到我的房间，我起身一口鲜血吐到地上，那一刻一切声音都停止了，邹桂荣哭着喊我的名字。他们汇报了队长，邹桂荣被留下来照顾我，这时他们还不忘迫害邹桂荣，让邹桂荣跟他们学断章取义的法，邹桂荣好久没有看到师父，看到师父的讲法，刚要拿那里的书，我无力的告诉她：我们不能在这里学，那是耻辱……她听话的看着我，把拿在手里的书放下了。我看着可怜的邹桂荣安慰她说：我们回家一定好好学。<br />In the evening, what happened last night was repeated because the guards on duty tonight had changed. Zou Guirong was again beaten and chased to my room. I got up and spat out a mouthful of blood on the floor. At that moment, all sounds stopped. Zou cried out my name. All this wasreported to the Captain. Zou stayed to take care of me but even then they didn′t stop persecuting Zou, asking her to &#8220;learn&#8221; from them as they misquoted the Fa. Zhou hadn′t seen (the picture of ) Master or read Master’s speeches for a long time. She reached for the book. I told her, with the little strength left in me, that we couldn′t learn here, that would be shameful &#8230; She understood me, looked at me, then put the book down. I looked at poor Zou and said, &#8220;We must learn the Fa well when we return home.&#8221;</p>
<p>那群魔鬼又一夜没有让我们消停。后来我床头的那个男的说：她的头和身上都烫手，别弄出人命，他们每个人都过来摸了我的头和身体，都消停了，那一晚我们不知是怎么过来的。<br />That group of devils again kept us awake the whole night. Later on, the man who stood by the head of my bed earlier said my head and body were too hot to touch and that I might be dying. Every one of them came to touch my head and body, and went quiet. We don′t know how we got through that night.</p>
<p>第三天，我和邹桂荣想起了任冬梅，她是一个未婚的大姑娘，被关在最里边的房间里。我俩已没有了生死的概念，冲到走廊大声揭露邪恶，呼喊着任冬梅的名字。三天没吃，没喝，没睡发烧的我找到警察，含泪告诉他任冬梅还是一个未婚的大姑娘，你们如果还有人性就不能伤害她。你们也有女儿。<br />On the third day, Zou Guirong and I thought of Ren Dongmei. She was an unmarried young woman in the innermost room. Having no thought of life and death anymore, the two of us rushed to the hallway shouting to expose the viciousness and calling Ren&#8217;s name. Didn′t eat or drink or sleep for three days, and with a fever I looked for the guard to tell him in tears that Ren was an unmarried young girl. I told him, &#8220;If there is any human nature left in you, you will not let her be hurt. You have daughters too.&#8221;</p>
<p>第四天，来了一群警察，我和邹桂荣各被两个男警架走，临走时我们不停的呼喊任冬梅的名字，任冬梅最后也被架了出来。那六个法轮功学员不知在里面是如何度过的。后来他们九死一生的也被非法秘密关押到沈新教养院。<br />On the fourth day, a group of guards came. Zou and I were taken away by two male guards. Before leaving, we kept on calling Ren’s name. Ren was taken out later too. It was hard to tell how the other six Falun Gong practitioners got by in there. Later on, narrowly escaping death, they were also secretly and illegally imprisoned in Shenxin Labor Camp.</p>
<p>我们九个法轮功学员用生命才保住灵魂的纯洁。多年来我从来没有把那里的经历详细的写出来，是因为我的精神已经崩溃，不敢也不愿想起。因为想起它，我就会陷在极度的恐惧和痛苦中。<br />The nine of us Falun Gong practitioners could keep the purity of our souls only at the risk of our lives. For many years, I have never put down my experience in there because my spirit was so crumbled by it that I dared not relive it. Remembering it would trap me in extreme fear and pain.</p>
<p>注：后来才得知道，那里在我们去之前已经“转化”了三十三位法轮功学员，有被迫害成精神病的，有被“转化”后在那里跟男犯处男女朋友的。总之是群魔乱舞邪恶至极的地方。多年来那里没有停止过对男女法轮功学员的残酷迫害。<br />Note: I learned later on that there were 33 &#8220;transformed&#8221; Falun Gong practitioners there before us. Some had gone insane from persecution; some were having relationship with male prisoners. In short, it was an extremely evil place where devils danced. The brutal persecution of male and female Falun Gong practitioners went on for years.</p>

<p><h2>六、打伤我的沈新教养院</h2>
<h2>6. Shenxin Labor Camp Injured Me by Beating</h2>
<p>这个教养院的院子很大，层层铁门，是专门关押男普教的地方，他们跟辽阳、马三家的男犯人一样，主要以劳役为主，每天劳役、唱歌、走步、军事化管理。男法轮功学员就在他们其中。如果坚定不“转化”，就会单独关押。当年女法轮功学员被单独关押一处，警察也是临时组建抽调来的。当年院长刘晶，主管迫害法轮功；队长郭勇，宋小石，邓阳（女）等，还有不到八名不记得姓名的女队长，她们二十四小时倒班看管迫害法轮功学员。<br />The Camp yard here was very big with layers of iron doors, a place specifically for male general education personnel. The same as male inmates in Liaoyang and Masanjia Camps, they were mainly laborers, did labor work, sang, and were marched everyday in military style. Male Falun Gong practitioners were among them. Those who were determined not to be &#8220;transformed&#8221; would put in solitary confinement. In that year, female Falun Gong practitioners were also put in solitary confinement. The guards were transferred and organized at the last moment. At that time, the director of the Shenxin labor camp, Liu Jing, was in charge of persecuting Falun Gong practitioners. Squad Captains: Guo Yong, Song Xiaoshi, Deng Yang (female, the director assistant of Shenxin Labor Camp), etc. and eight female Captains whose names I didn′t remember, took turns watching and persecuting Falun Gong practitioners 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>我和邹桂荣被带到了狱警大队，主管迫害法轮功的队长叫郭勇（当年四十多岁）把我们带到队长室，我和邹桂荣向他讲述了我们被多家教养院迫害的整个经历，要求给我们提供笔和纸，希望沈新教养院不要参与迫害我们。我们要在这里控告各家劳教所对我们惨无人性的迫害。当时不知道那个“黑牢”是哪里，我跟郭勇队长讲了那里的邪恶，也讲了这个政府都在耍流氓了，竟能做出把男人跟女人关押在一起的事情。如果不是我亲历，我无论如何都不会相信，就是听说我都有可能不会信。因为那个行为完全超出了我思想意识的底线。我问郭勇你能给我们解释马三家为什么邪恶到这种程度吗？为什么非要这样侮辱我们？它们的所为是否代表政府？她们也是女人，为什么害自己的同类，动物都不会。我们被折磨的四天四夜都没有睡觉了，郭勇说：我们这里不会，我们这里从来没有迫害过法轮功。我们这里是讲法律的。你们拿着行李让××（中年女队长，记不清姓名）队长带你们进房间好好睡一觉再说。我和邹桂荣、任冬梅在那里真的睡了一个好觉，几乎一年半的时间，我们从来就没有这样睡过。等我们醒来时，我们才好好看看我们住的牢房，这个房间四周都是上下床铺，但人只有我们三个。我们身边没有了包夹，我们真的就像吃了生日蛋糕一样，不知有多高兴，简直忘记了这是劳教所。<br />Zou Guirong and I were taken to a prison guardhouse. The Captain in charge of persecuting Falun Gong was Guo Yong (more than 40 years old then). In the Captain&#8217;s Office, Zou and I told him our entire experience of being persecuted in several Labor Camps, and our hope that Shenxin Camp would not participate in the persecution of us. We asked for pens and paper, because we wanted to sue the various Camps for their inhumane persecution of us. At the time, we didn′t know where that black jail was. I told Captain Guo the wickedness there, and told him the government was playing hoodlum as they even put male and female together. If I didn′t experience it personally, I would not believe it no matter what; that was to say even I could not believe it because that kind of behavior completely exceeded the bottom line of my thoughts. I said to Guo, &#8220;Explain why Masanjia’s wickedness has gone to this level. Why do you have to insult us like this. Are you acting on behalf of the government? There are women too –why hurt their own kind like that, even animals wouldn′t. We were tortured four days and four nights without sleep before coming here. Guo said, &#8220;We won′t do that here. We have never persecuted Falun Gong here and we follow the law here. Bring your luggage, Captain so and so [a middle-aged female, I can′t remember her name] will take you to your room. Have a good sleep first then we will talk.&#8221; Zou, Ren and I indeed had a nice sleep; we had not been able to have a sleep like that for almost a year and half. After waking up, we looked around our cell. It was a room with top and bottom bunks on all four sides. There were only the three of us. There were no &#8220;personal monitors&#8221; (baojia)&#8221; 〔NOTE:&#8221;Baojia&#8221; are handpicked criminal inmates to persecute practitioners around the clock. The intent is to monitor and control Dafa practitioners, and assist guards in forcibly brainwashing Dafa practitioners. The guards often exert pressure and lure them with different benefits, forcing them to use all kinds of cruel means to torture Dafa practitioners.〕around us. It was as if we had just eaten our birthday cake. I can′t explain how happy we were. We almost forgot this was a Labor Camp.</p>
<p>第二天郭勇把我和邹桂荣、任冬梅叫到队长室，郭勇说：你们的事我们向上面汇报了，你们可以写上诉材料，这里是纸和笔你们拿去写吧，我和邹桂荣谢过他，拿着他给的纸和笔回到房里。我们三个在那里第一次写下了我们被迫害的上诉状。几天后，郭勇叫女队长把我们写的东西交上去，因为纸张少，我们交上去的都是原件，这一跤上去就没了音信。邹桂荣听队长说她快到期了教养院联系到了她的家人，让其家属来劝劝“转化”，不“转化”就不会放人，邹桂荣就跟我说要把那写好的材料要回来，让家人偷偷带出去曝光。然后她就走到铁栏杆门前，跟郭勇队长要那材料。要了几次都没有回音，不一会儿，从铁门里出来两个女队长骂邹桂荣，然后气冲冲的拿来铁门钥匙，打开铁门，她们俩一把把邹桂荣抓起来，来回在走廊里轮着打。邹桂荣几次被轮番打趴倒地上，我见两个女队长越打越狠，担心邹桂荣再被打伤，我就冲到走廊抱起邹桂荣把她搂在我的怀里，不让警察再打到她，那两个队长就一起来拽我打我。<br />The next day, Guo called Zou, Ren, and me to the Captain’s room. He said, “I have reported your situation to the higher-up. You can write appeals papers. Here are pens and paper for you, take them and write.” Zou and I thanked him and took the pens and paper back to our room. The three of us wrote the appeals papers of our persecution for the first time. A few days later, Guo asked a female Captain to submit what we wrote to the upper level. Because paper was scarce, what we submitted were the originals and once submitted we heard nothing. Zou heard from the Captain that her term was almost up. The Camp had contacted her family asking her family to persuade her to “transform”. They would not release her unless she was “transformed.” Zou told me that they should get the written appeals back and give them to her family to take out secretly and expose the situation. Then she walked to the iron barred door and asked Guo to return the appeals paper. There was no response after repeated requests. In a little while, two female Captains appeared inside the iron door scolding Zou, then angrily took out the iron door key, opened it, grabbed her, and took turns beating her in the hallway. Zou fell on the floor several times from beating. I saw the two female Captains became more and more vicious. Worrying that Zou might get hurt further, I rushed to the hallway, picked her up, and held her in my arms, protecting her from being beaten by these guards. The two Captains dragged me and beat me.</p>
<p>见我抱着邹桂荣不撒手，一直站在铁门外观看的郭勇就一个健步冲进来，左手抓住我的头发往后拽，一条腿顶住我的腰部，右手猛击我的头、脖子和后背，我后背的骨头被他打得剧烈疼痛。两个女警队长同时拽打邹桂荣。我们俩就这样被他们打开。<br />As they saw that I would not let go of Zou, Guo, who was standing outside of the iron door, walked over swiftly, grabbed my hair with his left hand and pulled backward while used one leg pushing against my waist, and smacked my head, neck and back with his right hand. The bones of my back were in acute pain. Two female Captains dragged and beat Zou. The two of us were therefore separated. </p>
<p>之后我的头几天都抬不起来，头发被拽掉一地。<br />After that, I couldn′t lift my head for days, and my hair fell out all over the floor.</p>
<p><h2>七、龙山教养院</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>7. Longshan Labor Camp</h2>
<p>二零零一年的五月一日，我被单独押送到龙山教养院，到那正好赶上放大假，刚一到那，值班队长就把我带到关押法轮功学员的分队，在晚饭前龙山教养院要求每个人都要写一份思想汇报。我就写下了我被迫害的简单经过，然后写上各个教养院对法轮功的问题是黑白颠倒，整天无聊的让人讲假话等等。我的思想汇报交上还不到半小时，我就被值班队长叫出去，要求收拾东西，把我转移到对面的铁门里，那里关押的是女普教。晚上值班警察找我谈话，说：你要遵守这里的规矩，不许散布不利于“转化”的言论。我们龙山教养院二百多人几乎百分之百的“转化率”，不能因为你使她们反弹。我说：我的言论如果真能起到那么大的作用，你不认为你们的理论有问题吗？为什么明知不对还要“转化”？他说：你以为我们愿意啊，这是我们说了算的吗？你到这里来没人给你“转化”，但你不要敬酒不吃吃罚酒，我们这里是专政机关，必要时我们什么办法都有，什么都可以为你用。我说你对死人还有什么办法吗？我说我会在这里绝食抗议，抗议对我的非法秘密多次转押到底，直至生命最后一息。马三家没有把我迫害死，那就死到你们这里，这回你们龙山教养院也在全国出出名。<br />On May 1, 2001, I was escorted alone to Longsan Labor Camp. It happened to be during major holidays. As soon as I got there, the shift Captain took me to the building detaining Falun Gong practitioners. Before dinner, the Camp asked everyone to write an ideological report. I wrote a brief history of my persecution, and about those Camps that turned the Falun Gong issue upside down asking people to tell lies senselessly all day long, etc. Within half an hour after I turned in my report, the shift Captain asked me to pack, and I was relocated to inside the iron door on the opposite side where they detained female general education personnel. In the evening, the shift guards said to me, “You must follow the rules here, not spread words that will be harmful to “transformation.” With more than 200 in Longsan Camp, the “transformation” rate has been nearly 100%; we couldn’t let you have negative repercussions on this.” I said, “If my words could truly cause that big an effect, don’t you think there are problems with your theory? Why try to “transform” knowing it is wrong?” He said, “You think we want to? You think what we think matters? You were sent here, you should have “transformed,” not waited until forced to. We are a dictatorship institute with all kinds of means – if necessary, we could use them all on you.” I said, “To a dead person what means do you have?” And I also said, “I would protest with a hunger strike, protest until the end of the illegal secret detentions and transfers for a long time – until the last breath of my life. Masanjia didn’t persecute me to death, I could die here to make Longshan Labor Camp infamous throughout the country.”</p>
<p>接下来，每个值班的警察队长，包括当年姓唐的院长和张教导员，他们每晚值班时，都找了我谈话。我向他们一一讲了法轮功的真实情况和被各家教养院迫害我的经历和手段。我的思想和感受也没忘讲给他们。我对他们说：在这场邪恶的迫害过程中，我分清了正义与邪恶，我不是你们说的是法轮功的顽固分子，我是宁死也不跟从你们做一个千古的罪人、打手和邪恶的人。我是在坚守着这个，是法轮功的理念帮助我做到了这一点。就单凭我的境界，我还真做不到，如果我不看到《转法轮》这本书，你相信我对针扎我的人会怎样？所有参与迫害我的人，都应该感谢李洪志老师才对。这种超然的境界是我用生命的代价，在正与邪的艰难选择中，才体悟、感悟到的。对于李洪志老师我本来不了解，“法轮大法好”、怎样的好，我感悟的也不那么深入，可是你们这一迫害，善恶一分明，我才越来越感悟到，这个老师他怎么这么好，这么了不起，我发自内心的敬仰他，因为他教会了我在最痛苦的时候，在失去个人利益的时候，如何的做一个人。这样正的人，你不认为我该去敬仰和尊敬吗？反过来，我为了说一句真话，在这场邪恶的迫害过程中，让我见证那么多丑恶的嘴脸，邪恶至极的程度让我用人间的语言都无法描述。<br />After that, every Captain on duty, including the then Camp Director Tang and Instructor Zhang, all talked to me. I explained to each of them the truth about Falun Gong and the means of persecution that I experienced in various Labor Camps. I also told them my thoughts and feelings. I told them that, in the process of this malicious persecution, I distinguish the just and evil. I wasn′t what they said – a stubborn Falun Gong person – I was someone who would rather die than follow them to be a sinner for all eternity, a thug, and an evil person. It was this I firmly stood by, and it was Falun Gong&#8217;s philosophy that helped me achieve this. If I simply relied on my own self I would not really be able to do it. If I didn&#8217;t read the book &#8220;Zhuan Falun&#8221;, how do you think I would deal with those who pocked me with needles? It was only right for all those involved in the persecution of me to thank Master Li Hongzhi. It was the cost of my life and the difficult choice of just and evil that enabled me to comprehend and realize this kind of transcendent realm. I didn′t used to understand Master Li Hongzhi, and I didn′t used to deeply comprehend &#8220;Falun Dafa is Good,&#8221; how good it is, but with your persecution, once the good and evil were clear, more and more I realized how good, how extraordinary Master was. I revered him from bottom of my heart because when I was in the most painful time and lost all personal interests, he taught me how to be a person. Don′t you think I should revere and respect this kind of righteous person? On the other hand, because of each truthful word that I said, the process of this evil persecution allowed me to witness so many ugly and evil features that no human language could describe the extent of its wickedness.&#8221;</p>
<p>警察也是人，他们没有一个听不懂我的话，都表示这是他们的工作，上指下派，上面让怎么做就怎么做。不工作没饭吃。有一个警察队长说，你要不服就去找江泽民，去告江泽民，我们还解脱了呢。一天，龙山教养院的张姓教导员值班找我谈话，小声告诉我：你要把你的事一定要让家里人知道，要不然你死都不知道怎么死的。江泽民已对你们法轮功下令，你们死了会白死的，对你们会杀人灭口的，明白吗？我谢过他，同时也给他不到七岁的孩子讲了真善忍好。（他值班时带了孩子）<br />Guards are human beings too. They all understood my words, yet they all said that their work was directed by the higher-ups, they simply did what the higher-ups asked them to do. No work, no livelihood. One Captain said, &#8220;If you weren′t here, you could go look for Jiang Zemin and sue him. We would be relieved then.&#8221; One day, when Longshan Labor Camp’s instructor Zhang was on duty, he whispered to me, &#8220;You must tell your family what has happened to you, or they wouldn′t even know how you died if you died. Jiang Zemin has given the order about Falun Gong that your death will be reported as suicide. You would be killed to prevent you from divulging secrets, understand?&#8221; I thanked him. He took his child, not yet seven years old, to work each day. I told his child that Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance was good. </p>
<p>在龙山教养院我见到了我的妈妈、孩子和弟弟。那个教导员智慧的帮助了我，偷偷的给我的妈妈打了电话。<br />In Longshan Labor Camp, I met with my mother, child, and brother. That instructor intelligently helped me, having called my mother secretly.</p>
<p>在龙山教养院的十天，被四个女犯人倒班包夹，行动受限。我就含泪跟她们讲我们被迫害的真相和法轮功的美好，教她们背《洪吟》，帮助她们解开心结，引导她们在任何环境下都要做一个好人，重德行，让家人少操些心。她们在变好，我做了警察做不到的事情。女警见犯人们的心不再那么浮躁，在变好，对我的一切所为避而不见。法轮功给她们减轻了工作压力，因为监狱和教养院最怕犯人年、节想家出事。<br />In the ten days in Longshan Labor Camp, four female inmates took turns flanking me. This limited my actions. I told them in tears the truth about how we were persecuted and the beauty of Falun Gong. I taught them to recite &#8220;Hong Yin&#8221; [A Book of Poems by Li Hongzhi who founded Falun Gong.] I helped them undo the preoccupation in their hearts, and guided them to be a good person in any environment, to attach importance to morality, and to lessen the worries of their families. They were changing for the better. I did what a guard was unable to do. Female guards saw the inmates were no longer restless, they were changing for the better, and they avoided seeing everything I did. Falun Gong reduced their working pressure because what Prisons and Camps were most afraid of was disturbance caused by inmates&#8217; homesick in New Year and other holidays.</p>
<p>在那里我时刻没有忘记被它们洗脑后“转化”的昔日同修们。看到她们排着队去食堂吃饭，我想到了师父。我的心一阵剧痛，“耻辱”二字堵住了我的心脏，我的血液在倒流，眼含泪水冲到普教的窗口，对着大院食堂，我大声的喊 “法轮大法好，法轮大法好……还我师父清白，还我师父清白”，“法轮大法好，……还我师父清白”……<br />While there, I never forgot the former fellow practitioners after they were “transformed” by brainwashing. Seeing them lining up at the canteen for meals, I thought of Master Li. A burst of sharp pain pierced my heart, the word “shame” blocked my heart, my blood flew backward, tears splashed on the window – .I yelled loudly across the canteen, “Falun Dafa is good, Falun Dafa is good … my Master is innocent, my Master is innocent,&#8221; again and again &#8220;Falun Dafa is good, my Master is innocent …”</p>
<p>五月十号，十天没吃一粒米、没喝一口水的我，被龙山教养又给我推回了沈新教养院，因为他们怕我死在龙山教养院，又怕影响他们的“转化率”。<br />On May 10, without eating a grain of rice or drinking a sip of water for ten days, Longshan Labor Camp sent me back to Shenxin Labor Camp because they were afraid I might die in Longshan Labor Camp. They were also afraid I might affect their &#8220;transformation rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>到沈新教养院我见到了邹桂荣、任冬梅、周艳波和赵素环等。赵素环等六个法轮功学员从那“男黑窝”也活着闯了出来。我们九个又被关在了一起。因为我十天没吃没喝，被沈新教养院的队长郭勇带着男犯人拉出去野蛮灌食。邹桂荣见我们超期关押的问题解决无望，为了减轻我被迫害的压力，她又一次的绝食抗议。先后又有两名同修绝食，我们以此行为强烈要求见沈阳司法局的局长。<br />When arriving at Shenxin Labor Camp, I saw Zou Guirong, Ren Dongmei, Zhao Suhuan and Zhou Yanbo, etc. Six Falun Gong practitioners including Zhao Suhuan also escaped from that &#8220;male black den&#8221; alive. The nine of us were again confined together. Because I didn′t eat or drink for ten days, I was dragged out by Shenxin Camp’s Captain Guo Yong along with some other male inmates to be savagely force-fed. Realizing that resolving the problem of our extended confinement was hopeless, Zou Guirong once again went on hunger strike to relieve my pressure of being persecuted, and two other practitioners also went on hunger strike successively. We used this act to strongly request to see the head of Shenyang Judicial Bureau.</p>
<p>不记得是哪一天，我和赵素环被灌完食后叫到楼上，在那里我们俩见到了沈阳市的司法局长 韩广生。他听完了我们的经历，我跟他讲了我被马三家残酷的迫害被针扎的事件和被关男所事件。我们已经面临超期关押，他问了一些事情，他说看过我们的材料。我们的事情他说回去会研究。于是我们都吃了饭，等着他回去研究的结果。<br />I can&#8217;t remember on which day after we were force-fed, Zhao Suhuan and I were called upstairs where we met with the Shenyang City Judicial Bureau head Han Guangsheng. After he finished listening to our story, I told him the persecutions I experienced in Masanjia: tortured brutally, poked by needles, and locked in a male cell. Our sentence was already extended. He asked some things, and said he read our materials, that he would study our situation after he went back. So we ate and waited for the result of his report.</p>
<p>不记得是哪一天，结果出来了，马三家教养院女二所恶警王树增（音）拿着三个档案袋，到沈新教养院给我和邹桂荣、任冬梅加期，让我们在加期单上签字。邹桂荣无法接受这事实，精神都要崩溃了，把那个加期单撕毁了。我对邹桂荣说：不要撕毁，将来都是迫害我们的证据。王树增说，撕了也加期。拿着档案袋就走了。我们因此又一次绝食抗议，要求无条件释放。因为我们再也没有别的办法了，只能不吃教养院的饭了。我们身体虽被囚，但精神一定要无罪。<br />Again I can&#8217;t remember on which day, the result was out. Masanjia Labor Camp No.2 Female Building’s vicious Guard Wang Shuzeng (this was the sound of her name – I&#8217;m not sure of the spelling) took three files to Shenxin Camp to deliver the extended terms of Zou Guirong, Ren Dongmei, and me, and asked us to sign on the extended term papers. Unable to accept the fact and almost mentally collapsed, Zou Guirong tore up the extended term paper. I told her not to tear it up but to save it for the future as evidence of our persecution. Wang Shuzeng said, the term was extended, tearing it or not, and took the file bag and left. We, therefore, once again went on hunger strike to protest, requesting unconditional release, because we had no other means, we could only refuse eating the Camp food. Although we were confined physically, we had to remain resolute spiritually.</p>
<p>绝食期间，我和邹桂荣被关进禁闭室，我们俩被隔开，我在一号禁闭室，邹桂荣在三号，郭勇天天和宋晓石还有院长助理邓阳带着男犯人拖拽着我们去灌食，几天后邹桂荣被强按着扎点滴，她不配合拒绝扎针，拔掉针头，恶警郭勇就重重地打她，她的脸被扇红了，五个手指痕印在她脸上。我焦急的在禁闭室内看着这一切，不停的摇撼铁门大声揭露邪恶，很想把恶警们的注意力引到我这里来，来减轻邹桂荣的被毒打的压力。看到我的同修遭到如此的毒打，我心在滴血，在禁闭室里我不停的大声喊邹桂荣的名字，“邹桂荣!邹桂荣! 邹….!你们不许打她!不许打她!”，邹桂荣也喊着我的名字。我和邹桂荣每天两次被恶警和男犯人从禁闭室强行拖拽出去灌食。男犯人拖拽我的过程中对我有猥亵行为，我大声揭露邪恶，指责沈新教养院违反法律，利用男犯给我们野蛮流氓式的灌食。没有想到的是，那次的抗议他们竟听进去了。接下来给了我戏剧般的一个回复。<br />During the hunger strike, Zou Guirong and I were put in separate confinement cells; I was in No.1 cell and Zou in No.3. Guo Yong, Song Xiaoshi, Camp Director’s assistance Deng Yang, and some male inmates came every day to drag us out for force-feeding. A few days later, while they held Zou down to push in the intravenous drip, she yanked the needle out. The vicious Guard Guo Yong hit her severely. Her face was slapped red with five finger marks on it. Anxiously watching all this from my cell, I kept shaking the iron door and loudly yelling against theirwickedness in the hope to divert the vicious guards&#8217; attention to me and thus lightening Zou’s pressure of being savagely beaten. Watching my fellow practitioner being so brutally beaten, I kept on calling Zou’s name loudly from my cell, &#8220;Zou Guirong!Zou Guirong! –You are not allowed to beat her! not allowed to beat her!&#8221; Zou also called my name. Zou and I were dragged out of our confinement cells by vicious guards and male inmates for force-feeding twice a day, every day. While dragging me, the male inmates molested me. I yelled to tell the wickedness, accused Shenxin Labor Camp of violating the law, using male inmates to barbarously force-feed us gangster style. What I didn′t anticipate was they listened that time, and what followed was a dramatic response.</p>
<p>一群白衣中青年男子（其中有男狱医和郭勇）手拿灌食的各种器具，站在禁闭室的铁门外，当时把我吓一大跳，我还以为我到了医院了呢，不知发生了什么事。回过神来一看他们都是平时给我拉出去灌食的队长，和男犯，那几个男犯人们也都穿上了白大褂，双手都戴上了白手套，面目表情非常严肃，好像刚被训过话，显得很正规。可是土豆就是土豆，永远冒充不了地瓜。简直太搞笑了，让人哭笑不得。他们穿戴虽然变了，“黑手”变成了“白手”，可是他们的恶性并没有改变。我被这群白影包围厮打，又一次被拉出去野蛮灌食。我的鼻子、喉咙和胃都被他们插出了血。<br />A group of young men dressed in white (among them some male prison physicians and Guo Yong) holding various apparatus for force-feeding, stood outside the confinement cells&#8217; iron door. I was shocked, I thought I was in a hospital, didn′t know what was happening. I soon recovered from the shock and saw they were the Captains and male inmates who normally dragging me out for force-feeding. Those male inmates also wore white outer garments with white gloves on both hands, Looking solemn as if they were just given a strict briefing, they appeared very formal but &#8220;potatoes is potatoes&#8221; and can never pretend to be sweet potatoes. It was too funny, I didn′t know whether to laugh or cry. Although their clothes had changed – &#8220;black hand&#8221; became &#8220;white hand&#8221;– their vicious nature did not change. I was surrounded and beaten by this group of white shadows, and once again was dragged out to be force-fed savagely. My nose, throat, and stomach were all bleeding from the insertion.</p>
<p>后来我的胃再不能插管，男犯就使劲捏着我的鼻子往嘴里灌，我几次被他们灌得几乎窒息身亡。<br />Later on, my stomach could no longer take the intubations, male inmates squeezed my nose hard to pour into my mouth, several times, I almost choked to death from it.</p>
<p>十一天后，我因尿失禁和血尿。教养院把我和伤痕累累的邹桂荣，还有周艳波，抬到沈阳大北地下监管医院，那时我们已经没有了人的样子，骨瘦如柴，精神崩溃、伤痕累累。<br />Eleven days later, because of my incontinence and hematuria, the Camp carried bruised Zou Guirong, Zhou Yanbo, and me to Shenyang Dabei underground prison hospital. At the time we were already out of shape, as thin as matches, had had nervous breakdowns, and were covered with scars.</p>
<p>五月二十七日这天早晨刚过九点多，沈新教养院的院长刘晶、大队长宋小石，郭勇，两名白衣男狱医、院长助理邓阳、矮胖中年（记不清姓名）女教导员，还有一群不认识的狱警和女队长，都来到了禁闭室。这阵势让我一阵恐惧。宋小石拿着圆盘钥匙，（那个圆盘上转圈都是钥匙孔，挂着各个牢房的钥匙）打开了禁闭室的门，又找到手铐的钥匙，放开了吊铐了一夜、血尿失禁的我。刘晶说你们还顽固不化，不要命了，江泽民有令，对你们法轮功顽固分子采取了灭绝政策，打死白打死，打死算自杀。你们还犯傻，还执迷不悟，你们死了这笔账可别算在我们身上。<br />On May 27 just after 9 am, Shenxin Labor Camp Director Liu Jing, Block Captains Song Xiaoshi, Guo Yong, two male physicians in white, Assistant to Director Deng Yang, a tubby middle-aged female instructor (couldn&#8217;t remember the name), and a group of prison guards and female Captains not familiar to us, all came in the confinement cell. This line-up frightened me. Song Xiaoshi, holding a set of keys, opened the cell door and, having found handcuff keys, released me from hanging up. At the time I had been hanging up the whole night, and I had incontinence and hematuria. Liu Jing said, &#8220;If you remain stubborn and don′t value your life, Jiang Zemin has given orders to use the extermination policy. Stubborn Falun Gong practitioners like you could be beaten to death to death and it would not help your cause because being beaten to death would be counted as suicide. If you are still so foolish as to obstinately persist in going about things the wrong way, the nature of your death would not be on my shoulders.&#8221;</p>
<p>中年女矮胖教导员走到我的面前急切的说：你是一个有孩子，有前途，有才华的女人，你将来一定会是一个前途无量的成功企业家，在法轮功的问题上你不要太强了，会没命的，写一个“转化书”还来得及，活着回去再炼吧，孩子。我说：谢谢你，如果我们不是在这里这样相识，我相信，我们的相处一定会像母女，但是，你希望我为了苟活背信弃义、违心的做出加害老师的事吗？一个母亲会教自己的孩子这样做人吗？你瞧得起这样的生命吗？<br />The tubby middle-aged female instructor walked up to me and said anxiously that I had a kid, a good future, I was a talented woman, I would certainly be a successful entrepreneur with boundless prospects so I should not be too headstrong with the Falun Gong issue. She said, “You could lose your life. There is still time to sign the “Transformation Paper” and stay alive to go home and practice.” She called me ‘child’. I said, “Thank you. If we hadn’t met like this I believe we would be like mother-daughter. But do you want me to break faith and abandon my rights to stay alive?, Do you want me to betray and harm Master against my will? Would a mother tell her child to behave like this? Would you respect me then?”</p>
<p>女队长们七嘴八舌都过来指责我不知好歹，院长刘晶对宋小石说把她们带走吧。我和邹桂荣、周艳波被架出了禁闭室，上了一辆面包车，车上有两根大电棍伴随着我们。<br />The female Captains came over all talking at once how ungrateful I was. Director Liu Jing <br />told Song Xiaoshi to take us away. Zou Guirong, Zhou Yanbo, and I were carried out of the confinement cells and into a van with two large electric batons inside.</p>
<p>八、沈阳大北监狱地下犯人医院<br />8. UndergroundPrison Hospital of Shenyang Dabei Prison</p>
<p>沈阳大北监狱地下犯人医院，我不知它的历史和由来。在送我们到监管医院来的前一分钟，我们都不知将会送到哪里。车开到了这个大院，宋小石，院长助理邓阳，（她手里拿着一个档案袋）办理了一些手续，然后从大院的铁门里出来个中年男子，宋小石和邓阳走过去向那人交代了几句，然后让我们三个下车。我们互相搀扶着下了车，那人把我们带到了院中院，向铁门内的一个通往地下的通道口走去。<br />I didn’t know the history or origin of the underground prison hospital (Underground Supervision Hospital) of Shenyang Dabei Prison. We didn′t know where we were being taken to even at the last minute before we arrived at the supervised hospital. As the van drove to the compound, Song Xiaoshi, Deng Yang, the director assistant of Shenxin Labor Camp (holding a file bag in her hands) took me through some procedures. Then a middle-aged male came out from the iron door of the compound. Song Xiaoshi Deng and Yang walked over and said a few words to him and then asked the three of us to get out of the van. We helped each other to get off. That man led us to the middle of the yard, toward a passageway inside an iron gate leading underground. </p>
<p>我恐惧万分，停住了脚步，不敢再向前迈步。我的皮肤瞬间起了一层鸡皮疙瘩，身体瞬间冷的直打牙骨，我颤抖的问那个男的，你要把我们带到哪里，他看着我惊慌失措的眼神，对我说：这里是监狱的犯人医院，我姓郭（后来知道他是郭勇的弟弟），你们不要害怕。我们都颤抖著身体跟着他走了下去。走到再也看不到洞口时，我看到了一个铁栏杆门，门前有个办公桌，桌上放着登记册。那里坐着一个没有着装（穿的是便服）的二十四、五岁的年轻小伙子，他凳子的右侧开着一扇厚厚的、看样子很重的隔音铁门（我在那男黑窝，和马三家的小号见过这种门，但这里的门要比那些地方的重和厚，重厚度至少多出一倍），等我们走到跟前被登记时，我看到了那个开着的铁门里，是个凹状的水池子，里边有水。看样子我们到 那时，那里正在放风，那个小伙子见我看到那里，就把那门关上了，等我再想看时，什么都没有了，就是一面墙。我的思维瞬间被这一幕弄乱了，在怀疑自己的视觉。（后来回到家，我看到石家庄女法轮功学员丁延被迫害致死在水牢里的报导，我脑海里瞬间出现了在地下监管医院看到的那个凹状的水池。我现在确定那就是水牢。相关报导连结:<br />http://www.minghui.org/mh/articles/2002/5/16/30268.md#1 狱中得法的大法弟子忆丁延http://www.minghui.org/mh/articles/2001/9/6/16076.md#1石家庄大法弟子丁延被承德监狱恶警虐杀https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS-2_O_uCbY 电影 《震撼》 完整版 &#8220;Shake the World&#8221; 大陆禁片http://free-gate.org/do/z__Z/dAPWLXAYPQbRLj8P/Xz/v2aAxDN3/s&#8211;V/4/rH/77248.md#1</p>
<p>I was so fearful that I stopped and didn′t dare to go forward another step. Instantly, I had goose bumps all over my skin, my body immediately got so cold that my teeth quivered. While shivering, I asked that man where they were taking us. He looked at my frightened eyes and said to me, &#8220;This is Prison’s inmates hospital. I am Guo (later on I learned that he was Guo Yong’s brother,) you need not be afraid.&#8221; I followed him down the steps with my shivering body. When we could no longer see the entrance steps, I saw an iron barred door with a desk in front of it. On the desk was a registration booklet. A plainclothes 24 or 25-year-old young man was sitting there. On the right side of his stool was an opened, very thick, very heavy-looking soundproofed iron door. (I had seen this kind of door in that male black den and Masanjia’s solitary confinement, but the door here was at least twice as heavy and thick.) When we walked to the desk to register, I saw beyond the opened iron door, a deep pool of water. It looked like the inmates were being let out into the yard when we got there but when that young man saw me looking at the pool, he made a point of shutting that door. When I strained to see inside again, I could see nothing, just the door. My thoughts were immediately messed up by this scene. I could not work out what it was. (Later on, after I returned home, I read about Shijiazhuang Dafa practitioner Ding Yan being persecuted to death in a water dungeon, I thought of that scene. I am sure now what I saw in the underground supervision hospital is the water dungeon.Please see:<br />http://www.clearwisdom.net/emh/articles/2002/5/24/22365.md#1A Practitioner Who Obtained the Fa in Jail Recalls Dafa Practitioner Ms. Ding Yan and also http://www.clearwisdom.net/emh/articles/2001/9/7/13629.md#1 and also http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/shake-the-world/For specifics about water dungeons read http://free-gate.org/do/Qa_Z/ttoLeDgG8oR9fjXLYga/NXz/v2aAxDN3/s&#8211;V/H/W/49890.md#1 Illustrations of Torture Methods Used to Persecute Falun Gong Practitioners (19-30))</p>

<p>铁栏杆门响了，出来两个女犯，年轻的看守对那两个女犯说，你们搜一下她们的身，给她们分一下房，带回房去吧。锁铁门的叮当声再次响起时，我们突然听到一个撕心裂肺的喊叫声，救命啊!快救命啊!一个男的声音在凄惨的喊救命。女管房见我们害怕的样子就告诉我们，这里是监狱医院，天天都会这样。那边铁门里关的都是男病犯。那个叫喊的关在这里十多年了，是个政治犯。别害怕。你们不是法轮（功学员）吗？这里总有法轮（功学员）进来。（注：后来上厕所时见到过那个政治犯，那个人非常高大、头发、胡子都很长很乱，毛发、脸上都是大便，戴着手铐和脚镣，听到最响的镣铐声就是他出来了。他有专人看管。）<br />The iron barred door behind the guard opened, two female prisoners came out. The young guard told them to search our bodies, assign cells and take us there. When the iron door locking sound rang again, we suddenly heard a male voice miserably crying for help as if his heart and lungs were torn apart into pieces, “Help! Help quickly!” The female cell guard saw how afraid we were. She told us that this was a prison hospital and it was like this every day. “On the other side of the iron door, the patients are all sick male inmates,” she said. “The one who’s crying out loud has been here for more than ten years. He’s a political prisoner. Don’t be afraid – aren’t you all Falun [Falun Gong practitioners]? There have been Falun coming here all the time. (Later on when I went to the toilet room, I saw that political prisoner. He was very tall, his hair and beard were long and messy. His hair and face were covered with excrement. He wore handcuffs and fetters. When we heard the loudest sound of fetters and handcuffs, it was him coming out. There were special guards watching him.)</p>
<p>进到房里，我们三个被分到了走廊的一张单人床上，床上有一个破旧不堪发黄的破被罩，看守又给我们扔进来一个棉花套，那发黄的棉花套都是大小窟窿，一使劲都能拧出水来。这时我们才发现这里根本就没有黑天白天的概念，阴暗潮湿。走廊的尽头就是一个破旧木板屏风，屏风后面就是大大小小各式各样的小便盆，因为这里一天就放茅厕两次。早上和晚上各一次。我们暂时就住在这个走廊里，头顶就是那个屏风。那个味道至今难忘。<br />We entered the room and the three of us were assigned to one twin bed in the hallway. On the bed was a very ragged yellowish blanket. The guard threw in a cotton cover full of different sized holes; when we squeezed it hard water dripped from it. At this point, we realized there was no concept of night and day, all was dark and damp. There was a battered wooden screen at the end of the hallway behind which were urinals of various shapes and sizes . We were only allowed to use the latrine twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. At that time we lived in the hallway with the screen next to our heads. I cannot forget the smell to this day.</p>
<p>到了这里管二号房的王姐走到了我们中间，她五十多岁，她主动向我们了解了法轮功被迫害的真相，她也跟我们讲了一些她在看守所看到法轮功学员被打的情况。详见：《我在狱中见到的三十四位法轮功弟子》<br />When we arrived, Ms. Wang, who was responsible for No.2 room, walked up to us. She was about 50 years old and took the initiative to understand from us the truth about the persecution of Falun Gong. She also told us some situations of Falun Gong practitioners being beaten that she had seen. For detail see &#8220;I met 34 Falun Gong practitioners in prison.&#8221; 《我在狱中见到的三十四位法轮功弟子》</p>
<p>王大姐见我伤的厉害，就把我叫到她的管房里，给了我一些生活用品，然后告诉我，在这里一定要吃饭，把命先保住。有个龙山教养院送来的孙红艳，就被这里杂役（男犯人）常拉出去灌食，最后大小便失禁了，听这里的人讲那罪遭的，不行了才被拉走，听说到家就死了。你可要好好活着，教教我们也炼炼功。我说好，那我们就一起学，五套功法我还没学太会呢。<br />Ms. Wang saw that I was hurt badly and called me to her cell. She gave me some supplies and said to me,〝You must eat to keep alive first. Sun Hongyan who was sent by Longshan Labor Camp was often dragged out by a handyman (male inmate) to be force-feed, and ended up incontinent. People here said that she was tortured so badly. She was nearly dead when they released her. And she died right after returning home. You must survive no matter what, and teach us the Falun Gong exercises.〞I said,〝Alright, let’s learn together, I have not learned the complete five sets of exercise yet.〞</p>
<p>于是邹桂荣和周艳波就教我们炼功，她们两个都会背经文，我只会背《论语》、《洪吟》，那里两个房四十多人有一多半的犯人跟我们学炼功，每个人都会背几首《洪吟》。我在那里学会了全部的功法。大北监狱的女病犯们，通过背诵《洪吟》后，很 少再听到骂人、贪占别人的物品了。我们三个的身体通过学法炼功，很快恢复了一些元气。〔注:《论语》:《转法轮》前言 。《洪吟》: 法轮功创始人李洪志先生的诗集。〕<br />Thereafter, Zou Guirong and Zhou Yanbo taught us the exercises. They both could recite aures, while I could only recite&#8220;Lunyu&#8221;[&#8220;On Buddha Law,&#8221; also known as &#8220;Lunyu,&#8221; written by Li Hongzhi. It prefaces Zhuan Falun and other books by Mr. Li Hongzhi.] and “Hong Yin”[“Grand Verses” by Li Hongzhi ]. Of the 40 some people in the two cells, more than half were learning the exercises with us, everyone could recite a few poems in “Hong Yin.” I learned all five sets of the exercises. After reciting “Hong Yin,” female inmates in Dabei Labor Camp rarely cursed others or took other people’s things. The three of us recovered some vitality rapidly through learning the Fa and practicing the exercises.</p>
<p>二零零一年的六月五日，沈新教养院见我们三个还活着，没有像他们预期想的那样，白跟我们道别了，就恼羞成怒的把我们拉回了沈新教养院。<br />On June 5, 2001, seeing the three of us were still alive, which was not what they expected, Shenxin Labor Camp felt saying goodbye to us was in vain. Shamed into anger, they dragged us back to Shenxin Labor Camp.</p>
<p>回到沈新教养院，这一群恶警就像疯了一样，大声骂我们，还说监管医院有我们三个都成了法轮世界了，成了炼功场了。<br />Back to Shenxin Labor Camp, this group of evil guards yelled at us so loud it seemed they hag lost their minds. They said the three of us made the prison hospital a Falun world, a Falun Gong exercise ground.</p>
<p>回到沈新教养院的第三天，一群警察开完会出来，进到我们的房里，强行让我们穿劳教服装，我拚死不穿，一群男女警察就把我拽到郭勇办公室，郭勇二话没说，拿起桌上的大电棍就电击我，电棍劈啪的电击声，整个走廊都听得到，他边电击我边说：你就是一个劳教分子，把衣服穿上，你穿不穿，你就是个劳教分子。我被他电到沙发上，我对他说，我没有犯罪，是你正在对我犯罪，这衣服你穿最合适、你穿最对。他的电棍杵向了我的头和脸。我被他电倒在地，被一群女警和男犯人拖拽进禁闭室。邹桂荣被一群女警边打边骂也拖拽到禁闭室。一号、三号禁闭室成了我俩被随意迫害的基地了。<br />On the third day after we were sent back to Shenxin Labor Camp, a group of guards came straight out of a meeting into our room. They tried to force us to wear the prison uniform. I went all out refusing to wear it. A group of men and women guards dragged me to Guo Yong&#8217;s Office. Guo Yong immediately picked up the big electric baton on the desk and electric shocked me. The sizzling sound seemed to echo throughout the entire hallway. He continued to shock me, saying I was a reeducation-through-labor subject in the Camp and had to put on the clothes – wearing them or not, I was a reeducation-through-labor subject. I fell on the sofa from being electric shocked. I told him, I had committed no crime; that he was committing a crime doing what he was doing to me; that the clothes fitted him the best and he was the one most suited to wearing them. He poked his electric baton in my face and across my head. I fell on the floor and was dragged to a confinement cell by a bunch of female guards and male prisoners. Zou Guirong was also dragged into a confinement cell by a bunch of female guards while being yelled at and beaten. The No.1 and No.3 confinement cells became the base to persecute the two of us at will.</p>
<p>我俩又在这里相依为命了。一群警察上到楼上，因为楼上还有七名法轮功学员。看管禁闭室的人员还没来，邹桂荣跟我说：丽萍啊，丽萍，这里又是咱俩。我说：是，不要嫌少，就是这个世界就剩你一个还活着，你也不能穿那罪恶的衣服。她说：知道了；丽萍啊，你现在咋样啊？我说：姐，你没有事吧？她哭着说：丽萍啊，丽萍。两行无声的泪水，我再也无法止住，“姐，你不要担心我，我不会死的，我会一直和你在一起的。”她说，我也一直会和你在一起的。我说，知道了，你给我背经文啊，姐。她说，你要听哪篇？我说：咱俩一起先背《无存》，你再给我背《位置》。她说，好。〔注:〈无存〉:《洪吟》中诗句。〈位置〉:法轮功创始人李洪志先生的著作《精进要旨二》中之一篇短文。〕</p>
<p>We two were relying on each other again. When a group of guards went upstairs – because there were another seven Falun Gong practitioners – and I was alone with Zou Guirong,she said to me: “Liping, Liping, it’s the two of us here again.” I said, “Yes, and it’s not too few. Even if you were the only one left alive in this world, you are not to put those sinful clothes on.” She said, “Yes I’ve got it, but Liping, how are you now?” I asked was she alright? She said in tears, “Liping, Liping. I cannot hold it anymore.” With two rows of silent tears I told her, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me, I&#8217;m not going to die, I&#8217;ll always be with you.&#8221; She said, “I will always be with you too.” “It’s alright, I know,” I replied and asked her to you recite some Scripture for me. She asked which article I would like to listen to. I said, let us recite “Nonexistence” together, then you recite “Position” for me. She said, okay. 〔“Nonexistence” in “Hong Yin”. “Position” in “Essentials for Further Advancement II” (by Mr. Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong) 〕</p>
<p>下午，这一群男女警察和男犯人们像土匪一样又闯进禁闭室，我们俩无奈的又一次被它们打扰。其中男警有宋小石，郭勇，还有一个中年男警，一直跟着迫害我们，但他很少说话，我一直都不知道他姓什么，女警有邓阳；他们进到禁闭室二话不说，上来就把我摁住，扒光了我的衣服，把我的衣服扔到了厕所，我的手再也无处放，我的身体任其群魔随意扭打，我的头发被他们拽掉一地。我的大脑一片空白，我用人类哪种语言都没法描述那一刻，那一刻的心情，我不想再活了，他们那一群魔鬼也扒光了邹桂荣的衣服，邹桂荣挣扎的声音传出很远很远。她哭了，我还没有见到过她在邪恶面前哭过。我们俩没有了语言的交流。我无声的流下了两行思念儿子的泪水，我双手抱肩，没有犹豫，我的头撞向了厕所边上唯一的一个带角的墙垛。警察们迅速的跑过来，把门打开把我摁倒在地，一只手被他们拿来手铐把我铐在地上的铁网上。我的头被撞出个大包。头晕眼花的我，一个手挡着前胸佝偻著身体，艰难的遮挡着我的前身，我昏昏沉沉的睡着了，什么都听不到了。<br />In the afternoon, this group of male and female guards and male inmates again charged into the confinement cells like bandits. Once again the two of us were the focus of their harassment. Among them, were male guards Song Xiaoshi, Guo Yong, and a middle-aged male guard who had been following and persecuting us all along. He rarely talked, I had not learned his name; and a female Guard Deng Yang. They entered the confinement cell. Not saying anything further, they pressed me down, stripped me naked and threw my clothes in the toilet room. I could not cover myself with my hands, my body was fumbled by this group of devils at will. My hair was pulled out all over the floor. My mind went blank, there is no human language that can describe that moment or my mood at that moment. I didn′t want to live anymore. That group of devils also stripped Zou Guirong naked. The sound of her struggle must have heard far away. She cried, I had never seen her crying in front of wickedness. The two of us had no words to exchange. Missing my son, two rows of tears quietly flowed down my face. With my arms hugging my shoulders, without hesitation, with my head bowed, I ran into the only sharp protrusion on the bathroom wall. The guards rushed through the door, pressed me down on the floor, and cuffed my hand to the iron grille on the floor. The bump on my head from hitting the wall was huge. Fainting with blurred vision, I placed one hand in front of my chest and stooped my body to shelter the front of my body with great difficulty, and I fell asleep lethargically, not hearing anything anymore.</p>
<p>第二天，郭勇、宋小石，邓阳还有两个女警和两个男犯人拿着铁锹、铁镐、土篮子来到禁闭室。邓阳手指着我对男犯人说：你看这法轮功炼的多不要脸，衣服都不穿了，炼到最高境界了。两个男犯人看着我都笑了。厕所边上的那个小墙垛被他们刨倒了，抹上了水泥。我单手抱肩坐在那里任其随意观光。老天的眷顾，飞扬的尘土为我遮挡了部分的羞辱。<br />The next day, Guo Yong, Song Xiaoshi, Deng Yang, two female guards, and two male inmates carrying shovels, iron pickaxes, and baskets came to the confinement cell. Deng Yang pointed at me and said to the male inmates, &#8220;Look at this shameless Falun Gong practitioner, doesn′t even wear clothes, she must have reached the highest level in cultivation.&#8221; The two male inmates looked at me and laughed. The sharp object I′d dashed my head into was sawn off and smeared over with cement. I could only use one hand to hold my shoulder and my naked body was exposed for random viewing. Luckily, the flying dust shielded me and spared me some of the humiliation.</p>
<p>见我宁可光着也不穿他们的劳教服，以郭勇、宋 小石、邓阳为首的一群男女警察和男犯人们又一次的冲到禁闭室，进来就把我摁倒，打开手铐，强行给我套上了那罪恶的、代表劳教人员的衣服。这回他们把我的双手都铐在了地上的铁网上。我的精神再次崩溃，一口鲜血涌出来，我又开始了吐血。<br />Seeing that I′d rather be naked then wearing the Camp uniform, once again, a group of male and female guards and male inmates headed by Guo Yong, Song Xiaoshi, and Deng Yang came in and pressed me down, opened the handcuffs, and forcibly put the Camp uniform that represented crime on me. This time, they cuffed both of my hands on the floor iron grille. My spirit crashed again, a mouthful of blood gushed out, and I began vomiting blood again.</p>
<p>这回我不是绝食了，是太“恶心”了。几天不吃不喝的我再次被那群魔鬼拉出去灌食，也许我的身体太虚弱了，他们拉扯我时也没那么猛烈了，那我就跟你们这一群人讲一讲人的道理吧。我问他们家里是否有女人、有母亲、妻子和女儿，对我的所为你们是否想到了她们。<br />This time I wasn′t on hunger strike, it was too &#8220;disgusting.&#8221; For days without food or water, I was once again dragged out by those devils to be force-fed. Perhaps I was too weak, they didn′t drag me as hard, so I figured I could start talking reasonably with them. I asked if they had women at home, mother, wife or daughter, if they thought of them when they did these things to me.</p>
<p>每次把我拉出去灌食，都要经过教养院的大院，每次都有四个男犯人拽着我的四肢，脸朝天，拖拽到地方。<br />Every time I was pulled out for force-feeding, I would go through the courtyard of the Camp, and every time, four male inmates held my four limbs with my face up, to drag me away. </p>
<p>有冤无处诉，有话无处讲，我就对着教养院的天空喊着讲“法轮大法好”，“法轮大法好”，沈新教养院迫害好人天理难容。法轮功（学员）被超期关押在这里，不让见家人。沈新教养警察执法犯法随意打人，野蛮灌食，是他们在断我们的亲情。不要听信电视的谎言，法轮功没有错。在白云下，各层楼的铁窗里我都看到了光头，光头随着我的喊声多了起来，后来在几次的灌食途中，他们会伸出手来向我竖大拇指，还有敬礼的，光头们成了我的粉丝团，这回全楼都知道法轮功遭迫害了。闲暇间的话题就是法轮功。因为老天安排他们那段时间没出劳役。<br />With grievances but nowhere to sue, no-one to tell, I shouted to the sky over the Camp, “Falun Dafa is Good.” “Falun Dafa is Good.” “Shenyong Camp persecuted decent people – this is intolerable to Heaven. Falun Gong (practitioners) had been extensively detained, not permitted to see their families. Shenyong Camp has violated the law while enforcing it, beat people at will, force-fed people savagely. It is they who broke our family ties. Do not listen to the lies on TV, Falun Gong has done no wrong!” Under the white cloud, I saw shaven heads behind the iron windows of various floors. As I continued shouting, more shaven heads appeared. Later on, on my way to be force-fed, they would extend their hands out and gave me a thumbs up, some even saluted me, the shaven heads became my fans. This time, all floors knew Falun Gong was persecuted, and Falun Gong became the topic of their leisure conversation. Heaven must have arranged that they were not out doing hard labor at that time.</p>
<p>一天禁闭室的窗外多了个男孩子在打扫院子，他偷偷的从窗栏杆外递进一瓶可乐，和一个面包，他说，大姐你真伟大，真了不起，敢说警察。这是楼上一个哥们给你的，没有别的意思就是佩服你。你有什么事，快跟我说，我们都会帮你。我说，快记下我家的电话，一定要想办法叫我的家人知道我的事。他说接见时会叫哥们想办法。我说，你快把那吃的拿走，别让警察看见给你加期，他伸过头看到我的双手被铐着，就快速的把那瓶可乐和面包揣进了怀里，他边扫地边跟我说，我好不容易带到这。我说，谢谢你。没有收下他的食物，他有些失望。（后来这个男孩子帮助了我，我的妈妈找到这里。但没有让我见。）<br />One day, there was a boy outside the window cleaning the courtyard. He secretly handed me a bottle of coke and a loaf of bread through the iron barred window. He said, “Lady, you were really great, really amazing. You dared to give lessons to the guards. This was something for you from a guy upstairs. We can’t help but admire you. If you have any problems, let me know, we will all help you.” I said,”Memorise my house phone number quickly and be sure to tell my family about my situation.” He said, he would ask them to figure out a resolution to the visiting times. I asked him to take the food away quickly, not to let guards see it or his stay there may be prolonged. He moved his head further and saw both of my hands were cuffed. He quickly stuffed the bottle of cola and loaf of bread in his clothes and said to me while sweeping the ground, “It took me a lot of effort to bring the food here.” I thanked him but he was disappointed that I didn’t take the food. (Later on, this boy helped me, so that my mother was able to come to see me. But I wasn’t allowed to see her.)</p>
<p>因为楼上楼下的男犯人们，每天定点到铁窗前等待听到我声音的人数越来越多。我看到他们有互相争窗栏的现象，郭勇也看到了，抬我出去灌食的警察们看到了他们伸出窗外的大拇指。他们惊恐万分。<br />More and more male inmates upstairs and downstairs would go to the iron barred windows waiting for my voice at the fixed time. I saw them fight for the window space. Guo Yong also saw it. The guards who carried me out for force-feeding saw the thumbs up outside the windows. They were terrified. </p>
<p>从那以后我再也没有被抬出去过，他们开通了一个新的灌食通道。在灌食的路上我被两个男普教架着（不是四个抬着了），旁边是一群男女队长，郭勇告诉我，给你们灌一次五十元，跟你家里要。我告诉他我的家里没有钱，是你们知法犯法，不解决我们的问题，强行利用灌食迫害我们。郭勇气急败坏，左手一把抓住我的头发，另一只手连续猛击我的后腰，我的右腿瞬间自动往上收起，我痛的大叫，无法忍受那种痛。他边打我时边说：谁迫害你了，谁看见我迫害你了，谁看见我打你了，你给我找出证人了，你有能耐去告我呀。我全身痛出一身汗，大叫不止。把我抬回禁闭室，我已经不能站起来了，我的腰疼痛难忍，我的右腿落不下，一个腿长，一个腿短了。<br />Soon after this, they stopped taking me this way. They opened a new force-feeding passage. On the way to being force-fed, I was propped up by two male general education staff (no longer carried by four.) To one side was a group of male and female Captains. Guo Yong told me, it cost 50 RMB for each force-feeding and they were going to collect it from my family. I told him &#8220;My family have no money – you are committing crimes while aware of it. Instead of solving our problems, you use force-feeding to persecute us.&#8221; Flustered and exasperated, Guo grabbed my hair with his left hand and used the other hand punched my lower back repeatedly. My right leg instantly moved upward involuntarily. I was in so much pain I couldn′t help but cry out loud. The pain was unbearable. He yelled while beating me, &#8220;Who persecuted you? Who saw me persecuting you? Who saw me beating you? Find a witness! If you are able enough, go ahead and sue me!&#8221; Sweating throughout my body from pain, I kept on crying out loud. When carried back to the confinement cell, I could no long stand up, my lower back was in unbearable pain. I could not stretch my right leg. I had one leg long and one short.</p>
<p>第二天，宋小石和邓阳还有两个队长带着穿马甲（区分服）的两个男犯人把我架出了禁闭室，上了一个面包车，我被拉到沈阳的八院，我的腰被拍了片子。结果不知道，但从那以后郭勇很少单独出现在我的面前。<br />The next day, Song Xiaoshi, Deng Yang, and another two Captains along with two male inmates wearing the prison uniform yanked me out of the confinement cell and into a van. I was taken to Shenyang No.8 Institute. My lower back was photographed. I didn’t know the result but Guo was rarely left alone with me after that. </p>
<p>我一直也不知道姓名，很少说话，又每次都参与迫害我们的那个中年小个男队长，不记得哪天，他打开了禁闭室的铁门，手里拎了一袋饺子，我的一只手的手铐被他打开，他说，教养院的饭你不吃，这是你妈妈送来的，你该吃了吧？听到了妈妈，我泪如雨下。我问那队长，你们让我们母女用这样的方式沟通吗？这饺子你能吃下去吗？他锁上铁门走了。我看到那地上的饺子，我号啕大哭。在沈新教养院我没有见到我的母亲。<br />That middle-aged small male Captain whose name I didn’t know and who rarely opened his mouth while participated in the persecution of us every time, one day, opened the confinement cell iron barred door carrying a bag of dumplings. He opened the handcuff from one of my hands and said, &#8220;You don’t want to eat the Camp food. This was sent by your mother. It should be edible to you, right?” Hearing about mother, my tears fell like rain. I asked that Captain, “You let my mother and I communicate like this? Could you eat dumplings under these kind of circumstances?&#8221; He left and locked the door. I saw the dumplings on the floor. I cried my eyes out. I had not seen my mother once while in Shenyong Camp.</p>
