<hr>
	<p>【大纪元2015年06月19日讯】二零零一年四月十九日，结束了我在马三家七个月与魔鬼打交道的艰难岁月，这一天我一生都不会忘记……恶警把平时被她们酷刑折磨没有“转化”的法轮功学员先后都带了出来……我们九个被分别分到了九个房间，我被分到第一个房间，四个男人早已等候在那里。我上厕所时看到一个大房间里至少躺着三十多个不同年龄的男人在睡觉……<br />On April 19, 2001, my three years and seven months hard dealings with the demons of Masanjia Prison ended. I will never forget this day until I die … One by one, the vicious guards brought out all the Falun Gong practitioners that they normally tortured brutally but were unable to &#8220;transform&#8221; &#8230; The nine of us were placed in nine different rooms, I was in the first room where four men were already waiting. When I went to the toilet, I saw more than 30 men of different ages sleeping on the floor of a large room.</p>
<p>看了《小鬼头上的女人》，我的心再也无法平静，往事的记忆再次展现在我的脑海。罪恶的马三家，每当我想起它，我的心都在滴血。<br />After watching the documentary film “Above the Ghosts’ Heads: The Women of Masanjia Labour Camp”,my heart could no longer remain calm, memories of the past once again unfolded in my head. Whenever I think of the sinful Masanjia, my heart bleeds.<br />[“Above the Heads of Ghosts” was made by Mr. Du Bin, a New York Times photographer and published internationally, including in China, on the web on May 1, 2013. It documents the horrendous torture of female inmates, including petitioners and Falun Gong practitioners, who were abused at Masanjia Forced Labor Camp in China’s northern Liaoning Province.

<p>我叫尹丽萍，今年四十五岁，我是一九九八年的十月末看到《转法轮》这本书的。当时我还不懂这是一本指导人修炼的书，就是感到这本书很好，能指导我做个好人。我在生活中就想按照书中指导的那样在社会上做个好人。〔注：《转法轮》为法轮功（法轮大法）主要著作〕<br />My name is Yin Liping, I am 45 years old this year. It was in late October 1998 that I first read the book “Zhuan Falun.” At the time, I didn&#8217;t know this was a book guiding people to cultivate, I just felt this was a very good book, and it provided directions for me to be a good person. I wanted to follow the guidance of this book to be a good person in society in my daily life. 〔“Zhuan Falun” is the main text of Falun Gong(or Falun Dafa). 〕</p>
<p>没有想到的是，一九九九年，我的命运因此而发生了让人无法想像的变化。一九九九年的七月份我的家里来了很多人，他们是当地街道派出所的（现调兵山市，原铁法市，当时归铁岭管辖），调查我是否修炼法轮功，并到我家搜书，我和我弟弟尹宪武跟他们讲道理，说书是国家正规出版社出版的，我们花自己的钱在超市买的，怎么能把个人买的东西给你们。他们说搜书是上面的命令。我们姐弟俩坚决抵制他们这一群人的违法行为。最后他们就把我姐弟俩列为重点人物。<br />Little did I expect the changes that happened to me in 1999. [This was the year the persecution of Falun Gong began. Before then it was practiced in parks, factories, and any public or private place throughout China. The Chinese Communist Party estimated there were seventy million people practicing. This is now considered a conservative estimate.] In July 1999, many people from the local street police station (Diaobingshan City, previously Tiefa City, under the jurisdiction of Tieling) came to my house investigating whether I was practicing Falun Gong. They searched my house for Falun Gong books. My younger brother Yin Xianwu and I tried to reason with them by saying that the books were published legally, that we bought them in a supermarket, and that they could not take what people bought. They said it was an order from higher-ups to search for the books. My brother and I strongly resisted these people&#8217;s illegal conduct. As a result, we were considered the &#8220;key&#8221; target by the local police. </p>
<p>七月二十日后他们就派人天天在我家监控、蹲守和骚扰，警车、摩托车不断，我幼小的孩子吓得不知道往哪里躲藏。我家没有一天安宁的日子，我问调兵山管辖的小明镇的书记（不记得姓名了，是中年男子），你们为什么扰乱我家正常生活，他说：你以为我们吃饱了撑得没事干愿意来你家啊，我们是上指下派，你有能耐去找江泽民说去，我们还解脱了呢。<br />After July 20, [when the persecution was escalated, see http://en.minghui.org/cc/3/ for dates] they sent people to my home every day to monitor, to stay and watch, and to harass. Police cars and motorcycles appeared constantly. My young child was frightened and did not know where to hide. There wasn’t a single day of peace in my home. I asked the Secretary (a middle-aged man, I don&#8217;t remember his name) of Xiaoming County why he was interfering with my normal home life. He said, “You think we want to come to your home because we have nothing to do? We were sent by the higher-ups! If you had the means, you could look for and talk to Jiang Zemin, and then, not just you, but we would also be relieved!</p>
<p>被逼无奈，我把不到七岁的孩子留给了我的母亲，我和我弟弟走上了进京上访的路。没有想到的是，北京龙凤宾馆那里早已安排了当地的截访警察，一九九九年的九月我们被截访警察绑架回当地看守所（现调兵山看守所），一个月后我们被放出，回到家后才得知我的母亲被警察骗走九千五百多元，我和我弟弟才被放回（参见明慧网【明慧网2004年8月5日】http://www.minghui.org/mh/articles/2004/8/5/81039.md#1 辽宁调兵山市警察李伟执法犯法、勒索大法弟子钱财）。我弟弟被放回时脸色苍白，一米八四的个子瘦的不到一百一十斤。我们在看守所的一个月里被强迫做花（手工），背监规，强制打针，警察说是预防针，我用生命去抵抗这种强制不明行为。For lack of a better option, I sent my seven–year-old child to my mother so that my brother and I could go to Beijing to petition. Unexpectedly, Dragon Hotel, where we stayed, in Beijing had long arranged interceptions by the local police. We were abducted by them and sent back to the local police station (now Diaobingshan Detention Center) in September 1999 and were released one month later. Upon returning home, I learned that the police cheated my mother out of 9,500 RMB to have my brother and I released. When my brother was released, he looked pale and thin. He was 184cm in height but weighed only 55kg. During the month of detention, we were forced to make artificial flowers by hand, recite the prison rules, and were given injections that the police claimed to be immunization shots. I used all my strength to resist this kind of strong-armed, unsanctioned behavior.</p>
<p>回到家后对我姐弟俩的监控更加严重，派出所和街道的人员每天就派两个人在我的家里，那时我的家真的被他们搅得鸡犬不宁，孩子吓得夜里做噩梦坐起来大哭，怎么哄都不好，再也无法正常生活了。他们每个人都在说：我们是上指下派，我们也不愿到你家来，你要不服就去找江泽民去。<br />After returning home, the surveillance of my brother and myself became even more intense. Two people from the police station and street staff were in my house every day. At the time, my home was truly in great turmoil from their disturbance. My child was so scared that he often sat up and cried during the night because of dreadful dreams, and I was unable to calm him down no matter what I did. We were no longer able to have a normal life. Every one of them said,that they were sent by higher-ups and came to the house unwillingly.&#8221;If you don’t wish to submit to this,&#8221; they said, &#8220;you could appeal to President Jiang Zemin.&#8221;</p>
<p>无奈之下我又一次听了他们的话走上进京上访的路（因为那时我对这个国家还抱有幻想），没想到我这一次的上访竟成了我见证中共邪党迫害信仰“真、善、忍”群体的活见证人与亲历者。<br />In desperation, I once again took their advice and made the journey to Beijing to appeal. (I still had great delusion about the regime at the time.) I didn’t expect that my petitioning at this time would make me an active witness with personal experience of the wicked CCP&#8217;s persecution of the group of people believing in the principle of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance.</p>
<p>一九九九年十月至二零零零年一月七日期间，我先后两次上访两次被绑架关押在调兵山看守所。<br />During the time between October 1999 and January 7, 2000, I twice appealed and was twice abducted and detained in Diaobingshan Detention Center.</p>
<p>二零零零年一月七日上午十点多，那天大雪纷飞，天气出奇的寒冷，我和另外两名法轮功学员被劫持到一辆白色的面包车上，车上有两个警察其中一个警察手里拿着档案袋，旁边是两根电棍，他们一路无语。当车路过我家门前时，我才知道他们不是送我们回家。<br />A little after 10am on January 7, 2000, a very snowy and unusually cold day, two other Falun Gong practitioners and I were abducted in a white van. Two guards were in the van, one of them held a file bag in his hand and next to them were two electric batons. They were quiet the whole way. When the van drove by the front door of my house, I realized that they were not taking us home.</p>
<p><h2>二、铁岭劳教所：电刑、奴役，打死算白死</h2>
<h2>2. Tieling Labor Camp: Electric Shock, Slavery, Being Beaten to Death Counting as Suicide</h2>
<p>汽车行驶一个多小时后，我们才知道我们被送到了铁岭劳教所，我们被女警强迫脱光衣服搜身时，才从女警那里得知我们被劳教。女警说：你们现在就是劳教分子，要服从这里的一切规矩；我们这里有一切的办法让你们服从。（因我炼法轮功时间短，劳教我一年半，与我同行的法轮功学员分别被劳教两年、三年。）<br />Only after the van had driven for an hour or so, we got to know we were being sent to Tieling Forced Labor Camp. Only when we were forcibly body searched naked did we hear from the female guards that we were to be reeducated-through-labor. A female guard said that we were now subjects of reeducation-through-labor and were to obey all rules there. They said they had every means to make us obey. Because I hadn’t practiced Falun Gong long, my term was 1.5 years while the terms of the other two fellow Falun Gong practitioners who had traveled with me were two years and three years.</p>
<p>铁岭劳教所是个关押男人的地方，当年也非法关押了很多男法轮功学员。那里专门给法轮功学员成立了一个女队，我们被非法关押在三楼，一楼和二楼是男普教。我到那时，那里已非法关押了铁岭、开原、昌图、调兵山（原铁法市）等地二十五名女法轮功学员了。<br />Tieling Forced Labor Camp was a place for men. It used to be used to illegally detain many male Falun Gong practitioners. This camp specifically formed a female team for Falun Gong practitioners. We were illegally jailed on the third floor while the first and second floors were for male inmate. When I got there, the camp already jailed 25 female Falun Gong practitioners from Tieling, Kaiyuan, Changtu, Diaobingshan (formerly Tiefa City), etc.</p>
<p>我到的当天，女警就告诉我，如果谁在这里炼功就像张艳一样关禁闭，那时张艳已被关进去一天一夜。听同修说她被那里恶警王志斌用电棍电击全身敏感部位，她被电击时，她的姐姐也同时被迫害着，恶警们让她姐姐伸直胳臂，在上面各压一个板凳，同时用电棍电击她的后背。同修告诉我，最残忍的是，电击金贞玉（朝鲜族法轮功学员）让她的母亲金淑子看着，听其女儿的惨叫声；恶警还用同样方法强迫法轮功学员刘菲，让她听其妹妹刘军被电击的惨叫声。开原法轮功学员张淑霞被恶警王志斌电的满地翻滚惨叫。后来张淑霞跟我讲述了她被迫害的整个过程。更多迫害情况，参见明慧网二零零六年六月二十八日《电刑、奴役、暴力洗脑——辽宁省铁岭市教养院对女大法弟子的迫害》<br />On the day I arrived, a female guard told me that whoever practiced Falun Gong would be placed in confinement cell like Zhang Yan. At the time, Zhang had been in there all day and all night already. I heard from a fellow practitioner that the vicious Guard Wang Zhibin had beaten all of Zhang’s sensitive parts with an electric baton. At the same time her sister was also being persecuted. The vicious guards made her sister stretch out her arms, pressed a wooden stool on each arm, and then electric shocked her from the back. A fellow practitioner told me, the worst cruelty was when Jin Zhenyu (an ethnic Korean Falun Gong practitioner) was electric shocked, the guards made her mother Jin Shuzi watch and listen to her daughter&#8217;s screams. The same treatment was used on Falun Gong practitioner Liu Fei. The guards made her listen to her sister Liu Jun&#8217;s screams from being electric shocked. A Falun Gong practitioner Zhang Shuxia from Kaiyuan rolled all over the floor and screamed from being electric shocked by the vicious guard Wang Zhibin. Later on, Zhang told me the complete story of her persecution. For more persecution information, please visit,<br />http://en.minghui.org/emh/articles/2006/8/6/76410.md#1<br />&#8220;Electric Shocks, Slavery and Violent Brainwashing &#8211; the Persecution of Female Falun Gong Practitioners by the Forced Labor Camp at Tieling City, Liaoning Province&#8221;</p>
<p>二十五位法轮功学员无法相信政府会对我们一群修炼真善忍的人采取这样恶劣的手段，绝食抗议。我到那时，正赶上法轮功学员们集体不吃饭来争取自己的权利，楼下的男法轮功学员于占江因为声援女法轮功学员也绝食抗议，而被楼下的恶警打得面目全非，耳朵差点被打掉，缝了好多针。恶警打他时全楼都听得到，当时感到那个楼都在震动。几天后见到他人时，他的头连着耳朵还在包着纱布，眼睛青肿得只剩一条缝。<br />Unable to believe the government would take such spiteful action against a group of people practicing “Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance,&#8221; 25 Falun Gong practitioners went on hunger strike to protest. I arrived there at this time when Falun Gong practitioners were collectively not eating to strive for their rights. Downstairs, a male Falun Gong practitioner, Yu Zhanjiang, also refused to eat to support the female practitioners. He was beaten beyond recognition by the ruthless guards. He almost lost an ear that took lots of stitches to save it. When he was beaten, the whole floor could hear it. It felt like as if the floor was shaking. When I saw him a few days later, his head, including his ears, was wrapped up and his eyes were so bruised and swollen only a thin slit was left between his eyelids.</p>
<p>一天我被恶警王志斌叫到办公室，办公室的桌子上放着两根大电棍，他问我到这里来是否还炼法轮功，让我认清罪错写悔过书。我反问他我犯了什么罪被关在教养院里，他说你的教养票子上写的是你犯了“扰乱公共秩序罪”，我问他上访就是扰乱公共秩序吗？这是中国法律哪条规定的，他说那是公安局给你判的，跟我们教养院无关，他说对你们法轮功上面已经发给我们内部档了，他顺手拿过桌子上的档让我看，也就是“打死白打死”的政策，我说，谁执行他的命令，谁就是千古的罪人。他听了我的话没有给我用刑。但是在那一个月里我们被强行到冰天雪地的外面刨地沟干手工活。东北的冬天很冷的，那一年的冬天在零下二十～三十度左右。男法轮功学员在这么寒冷的冬天里，每天被强行拉出去奴役。<br />One day, I was summoned by the wicked guard Wang Zhibin to the office. Two large electric batons were lying on the desk. He asked me whether I still practiced Falun Gong here, and asked me to admit crime and sign the &#8220;Repentance Statement.&#8221; I asked him in return what crime had I committed to be jailed in this Camp. He said I committed the crime of &#8220;Disturbing Public Order&#8221; as written on my reeducation notes. I asked him if my petition in Beijing was what they called &#8220;Disturbing Public Order&#8221; and which stipulation in the Chinese Constitution indicated it was so. He said, &#8220;You were sentenced by the Public Safety Bureau, our Camp had nothing to do with it.&#8221; He also said that, with respect to Falun Gong, the higher-ups had already dispatched an internal document. He casually put the document on the desk for me to read. It was the policy of &#8220;Beaten to Death Counting as Death in Vain.&#8221; I said whoever carried out this order would be a sinner throughout all ages. He heard what I said and didn’t torture me. In that month, we were forced to go outside to a world of ice and snow to manually dig ditches. The winter of northeast China is very cold. It was 20 to 30℃ below zero that year and male Falun Gong practitioners were forced to go outside to be enslaved in such severe winter conditions every day.</p>
<p>铁岭教养院每天早上不到六点起床，吃的是没有蒸熟的玉米面、粘牙的大块发糕和漂满腻虫、不洗、带泥的白菜萝卜汤。男犯人有好多出工干活没有棉鞋穿的，有一天早上我们站排到饭厅吃饭，在出工的队伍里我看到了一个十七、八岁大的男孩子，在寒冷的冬天里他脚下只穿着一双夏天的凉拖鞋，双脚已冻得黑紫色，我无法接受这真实的一幕，我们国家的劳教所就是这样吗？就这么没有人性吗？那个孩子的母亲看到不知该有多么的心痛，我再也无法沉默不顾自己的安危跑过去，从要出工干活的队伍里，把那孩子拽出来，把我的雪地鞋换给了他，我穿上了那双冻得帮帮硬的凉拖鞋，我的双脚不到两分钟的时间就冻得受不了了，那个孩子感动得已不知所措。<br />In Tieling Forced Labor Camp, we got up before 6 a.m. every morning, ate half-cooked cornmeal, large sticky rice cake and soup made of unwashed dirty cabbage and radish covered with worms,. Many male prisoners worked outdoors without cotton-padded shoes. One morning, we were standing in line in the canteen for breakfast when I saw a 17 or 18-year-old boy wearing a pair of summer slippers in this cold winter. Both his feet were blackish purple from freezing. I was unable to take in what I saw: were our country’s Labor Camps really like this? So inhumane? How much pain would this boy’s mother feel if she saw this! I could not just do nothing anymore. Disregarding my own safety, I ran over to the outdoor working group, pulled the boy out of the group, put my snow shoes on him and put his frozen summer slippers on me. In less than two minutes, my feet were freezing so cold that I could hardly bear it. The boy was very touched yet did not know what to do.</p>
<p>这就是我见到的铁岭劳教所的冰山一小角。<br />This was merely a small tip of the iceberg of what I saw in Tieling Forced Labor Camp.</p>
<p>二零零零年的元月三十日这一天，铁岭教养院突然来了好多陌生警察和好几辆大客车，我们二十五位法轮功学员不知道发生了什么事情，就这样我们被警察强制戴上了手铐，两人铐在一起被押送到了大客车上，客车上有我们没有见过的两名女警察和两名男警察，和四根大电棍。<br />On the day of January 30, 2000, many guards unknown to us and several large buses came to Tieling Labor Camp all of a sudden. The 25 of us who were Falun Gong practitioners didn’t know what was happening. We were forcibly handcuffed in twos and boarded on the bus where two female guards and two male guards who we had never seen before had four big electric batons.</p>

<p>辽阳教养院一九九九年十一月为法轮功成立了女队，教养院主管迫害法轮功的政委叫邹化田，大队长叫孙爱勤，副队长姓尹，还有四个分队长：谷玉、张威、霍艳，还有一个朱姓队长。<br />In November, 1999, Liaoyang Forced Labor Camp formed a women&#8217;s team for Falun Gong, the Political Commissar of the Camp in charge of persecuting Falun Gong was Zou Huatian, the Captain was Sun Aiqin, vice Captain surnamed Yin, and four team leaders; Gu Yu, Zhang Wei, Huo Yan, and Chu (surname).</p>
<p>我们刚一到那里就被强行搜身，还没有被搜完就听到楼上警察打法轮功学员胡英的声音，因为尹姓副队长在她的行李中翻到了大法的书。等我见到胡英时，她的脸已被打得红肿。接下来我们的所有东西包括全身上下衣领内裤都搜个遍，还把被子里的棉花、枕头里的稻壳都倒出来。胡英当时遭受迫害的更多情况，见明慧网二零零八年十月三十一日《调兵山市胡英自述八年来的遭遇》<br />As soon as we got there, we were forcibly body searched, before the search was over, we heard the noise of guards upstairs beating Falun Gong practitioner Hu Ying, because the Deputy Brigade Captain Yin found Dafa books when rummaging in her luggage. When I saw Hu, her face was swollen and red from beating. After that, we were all thoroughly searched including the whole body, the collar, underpants, and everything, even the cotton in quilts and rice husk in pillows were all pulled out. For more persecution information of Hu Ying at the time, please visit,<br />http://www.clearwisdom.net/emh/articles/2008/12/4/102731.md#1 <br />&#8220;Ms. Hu Ying from Diaobingshan City Describes the Persecution She Experienced over the Past Eight Years.&#8221;</p>
<p>我被分到了二大队，接下来就是每天没日没夜的被奴役，把我们当成赚钱的工具，那里的手工制品都是出口到国外的，每天要干二十个小时的活。干不完定额就不让睡觉，为了达到让我们“转化”的目的，节假日都得十二点以后才能睡觉。不“转化”凌晨二、三点以后才让睡觉，五点三十分必须起床，洗漱上厕所的时间只有十分钟，超过一分都不行。不管你大小便上完没上完都得出来。老年法轮功学员出现了身体不适的症状也不照顾，也得干到后半夜。我因没有“转化”就不让我休息，白天出工干重体力活，晚上扎花，不许我睡觉，警察见我困了就打我，说不“转化”就别想睡觉。<br />I was allotted No.2 Brigade. What followed was slavery day and night every day as we were used as money-making tools. The handmade products we made were all exported to foreign countries. We had to work more than 20 hours a day, we were not allowed to sleep if the assigned quota was not completed. In order to achieve the purpose of &#8220;transforming&#8221; us, we could only sleep after mid-night, even on holidays. Those who were not &#8220;transformed&#8221; were not allowed to sleep until after 2 or 3 a.m. after mid-night, and still got up at 5:30 like everyone else. Only ten minutes were allowed to wash and to use the toilet, not a minute more, whether the act of discharge was completed or not, one had to come out of the toilet room. Older Falun Gong practitioners with symptoms of illness, were not taken care of but, moreover, had to work until after mid-night. Because I was not &#8220;transformed,&#8221; I was not allowed to rest. I had to do hard labor during the day and bind flowers at night. I was not allowed to sleep; whenever I was seen dozing off, the guards would beat me up and say, &#8220;no `transformation,’ no sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>出外役：就是挖树坑、平地、拆水泥袋子等，到轧钢厂压铁，装铁条、做石棉瓦、铺铁路等。<br />Outdoor work was digging tree pits, leveling ground, tearing open cement bags, etc. Work in the rolling steel mill was pressing steel, loading steel rods, making asbestos tiles, laying tracks, etc. </p>
<p>我和高金玲（现已被中共邪党迫害致死）、张艳、寇小坤，我们四个被分到钢厂（后来换过其他法轮功学员，但我从没换下来过，直到把那批活干完），每天我们四人要压八～九吨的铁条，如果钢厂的铁条被我们压没了，钢厂就会拉着我们四个到别的厂房拉铁条，因为他们买的铁条都是边角余料，放在院里堆的像座小山，我们必须得从那几米高的铁条堆里一根一根的把那铁条拽出来装到车上，一根大约一米到两三米长，宽一寸左右，铁条的边都是锋利的锯齿，一上午我们四个必须得装满一大卡车（四～五吨），下午一卡车，因为天气炎热（三十七、八度）我们身上都是汗水，我们自买的棉手套一天就被铁条刮废了不缝就不能再用了，我的手和胳膊被铁条划的都是血道子。因天气热，那铁条碰到我们的皮肤就会烫出水泡。我的脸被太阳晒的就跟黑人一样，只有牙齿是白的。警察见我还说：见到你还以为在外国呢（见到黑人的意思）。<br />The four of us, Gao Jinling (now dead from persecution by the sinful CCP), Zhang Yan, Kou Xiaokun, and I, were sent to the steel mill. (Later on, they were replaced by other Falun Gong practitioners, but I was never replaced, I remained there until the entire batch was completed.) Every day, the four of us had to press eight to nine tons of steel bars. If we finished pressing all the bars, we would be sent to other steel mills to get them. Because all the steel bars they bought were left over materials which were piled up in the yard like a small mountain, we had to pull them out one by one from piles several meters high and load them on a truck. The bars were one to three meters long, about one inch wide, the edges of each bar had sharp saw cut teeth. The four of us had to fill a large truck (four to five tons) in the morning and another one in the afternoon. Because the weather was blistering hot (37 to 38℃), we were all very sweaty. The cotton gloves we bought ourselves would be torn by the steel bars within a day, we either had to mend it or couldn’t use it again. My hands and arms were covered with bleeding cuts by the sharp edges of steel bars. Due to the hot weather, our skins were blistered from touching the hot steel strips, and our faces look liked like a black person’s from the sunburn; only our teeth remained white. The guards slyly laughed at our looks and said that looking at us made them feel as if they were in a foreign country, meaning that they saw black people.</p>
<p>有一天我们正在装车，突然看到高金玲的鞋上都是血，再看下身和裤子也都是血，我们告知了警察，朱队长没有理我们，我们还以为她没带卫生巾，就把我们擦汗的毛巾给她用，可是毛巾也不管用了，她的血流不止，鞋里都是血，她的脸瞬间就变得苍白，我们都急了，放下了手里的铁条来看护她。在这种性命攸关情况下，朱队长还让我们干活，我们急得让朱队长快过来看一看，高金玲大流血了，人都快不行了，这时她们才怕出人命给我们拉回教养院，高金玲被拉到劳教所的卫生所时人已经很危险了，嘴唇和脸都没了血色。听说卫生所给打了止血针。人都这样了，教养院的大队长孙爱勤并没有让她到床上休息，就让她在监室的水泥地下躺了一下午，说是这里是军事化管理，不能把床铺弄乱。第二天高金玲就被弄到干活的房间里，干不了活也得坐在那。<br />One day when we were loading the truck, I suddenly saw Gao Jinling’s shoes were full of blood. I looked again and saw her lower body and pants were also bloody. We told the guards, but Captain Zhu ignored us. We first thought she didn’t bring sanitary pads, so we handed her the towels we used to wipe off sweat. But the towels were useless, she was still bleeding incessantly. Inside her shoes were filled with blood and her face turned pale. We were so worried that we let go the steel bars in our hands to take care of her. In this critical live and death moment, Captain Zhu still asked us to continue working. I urgently asked Zhu to come over and take a look as Gao began to bleed in large quantities and she was dying. This time, fearful that she might die, the guards let us take Gao back to the Camp. When Gao was taken to the health center, her situation was quite critical, her lips and face were colorless. I heard that the health center gave her ahemostasis shot to stop the bleeding. Even when in such condition, Captain Sun Aiqin did not let her rest on a bed but made her lie on the concrete floor of the cell for the afternoon. The Captain said it was militarization management here in the Camp as Gao was not allowed to mess up the bed. The next day, Gao was brought to sit in the workroom even though she was unable to work.</p>
<p>在这之后，张艳昏倒在三米高的铁堆上。从那以后，我们才会偶尔喝到热水和唯一的一次绿豆水，因为她们怕我们都倒下给她们赚不了钱，后来我们才知道孙爱勤通过关系在外面包的活，我们每人出工一天她们都会得到一百或一百五十元不等，我们干的活比男普教都累。<br />After that, Zhang Yan passed out on a three-meter-high steel pile. As a consequence, we got to drink warm water occasionally, and once even green bean soup, because they were afraid that they would not earn money if we all got sick. Later on, we learned that Sun Aiqin took outside contract work through connections. She would get 100 to 150 RMB a day for each of us out working. The work we did was harder than that of male prisoners.</p>
<p>就干这么累的活，晚上回来还得扎花到深夜，有时通宵，过程中没有休息，我的头发到那后三天就白了大半；眼睛整天布满血丝，双手十指指肚扎花扎的血肉模糊已无法看清指纹；胳膊白天被铁条划的血迹斑斑一条一道的没有好的时候；晚上后半夜全身痛得都上不了床。<br />Even though we did hard labour, we still had to bind flowers late into the night after coming back, sometimes all night without rest. After three days, most of my hair turned white, my eyes were bloodshot, all my ten fingers were badly mangled with the loops and whorls all blurred from binding the flowers, my arms were full of bleeding cuts from steel strips and would be cut again the next day before healing. My whole body was in such pain that I was unable to get on the bed late at night.</p>
<p>我们还被迫做过石棉瓦，那个工作是要带防毒面具的，可是我们没有，那个毛毛刺扎到身上都找不到。我们被熏得不断的呕吐、迷糊。<br />We were also forced to make asbestos tiles that required gas masks if handled, but we were not provided with these. The furry airborne thorns disappeared soon after they got on our skin. We were dazed and vomiting continuously from inhaling the airborne fibers.</p>
<p>后来我因劳累过度，经常的大口吐血，有一次一口血喷出来吐得厕所的瓷砖上哪都是。警察并没有因此让我休息片刻。<br />Later on, I was so exhausted from overwork, I often spate mouthfuls of blood. Once I spurted blood all over the bathroom tiles, but the guards didn’t allow me to rest for a brief moment.</p>
<p>尹副队长因为与我同姓，每次她值班时就会趁没有其他警察时把我叫到她的办公室，了解法轮功的真实情况，见我吐血就偷偷的给我冲豆奶，我不要，她就告诉我，上边有令，你们法轮功死了会白死，你快喝了吧，先把命保住再说。这个尹队长打过法轮功学员，但了解法轮功真相后，她就暗中保护法轮功学员，为法轮功学员说公道话，后来她很快被降职调离了。<br />Vice Captain Yin and I shared the same family name Yin. Because of this, when she was on duty and no other guards were around, she would ask me to go to her office to explain the truth about Falun Gong. When I spat blood, she secretly offered me some bean milk. When I refused, she told me, &#8220;The orders from the higher-ups are that the death of you Falun Gong practitioners will be counted as death in vain. So come on, drink. Keeping yourself alive is the main thing.&#8221; Yin used to beat Falun Gong practitioners. After understanding the truth about Falun Gong, she began to protect practitioners quietly and said just words for Falun Gong practitioners. She was soon demoted to a lower rank and transferred to another department. </p>
<p>原来一百五十多斤重的我，不到几个月的时间一百二十斤都不到了，每个月的月经也没有了。我们在辽阳教养院谁都不知道什么叫休息；没有语言交流，因为那里不让讲话。在电影中我看到过奴隶，但奴隶也有休息睡觉的时候，可是我们法轮功学员在这里没有；什么都不许，包括见我们的家人和孩子。<br />I used to weigh more than 150 catty (75kg).In a few months I weighed less than 120 catty, and my menstruation stopped. In Liaoyang Labor Camp, we were not allowed to have breaks and conversations. Slaves that we saw in the movies could rest and sleep, but Falun Gong practitioners here couldn’t. Nothing was allowed here, including seeing our families and children.</p>
<p>老年法轮功学员出现了身体不适的症状也不会照顾，当年六十五岁的法轮功学员李玉琴因为长时间坐凉板凳双腿浮肿，就找了一块衣布坐在屁股底下，被小队长张威发现，上去就把那块衣布拽下来，然后就反手给她老人家一个反手嘴巴子，嘴里还不停的谩骂。这是我亲眼目睹的一幕。<br />Older practitioners were not taken care of when they appeared to have physical problems. There was a Falun Gong practitioners Li Yuqin, 65 years old at the time, both her legs were swollen because of sitting on a cold wooden bench for too long. She found a piece of cloth to place under her butt. Team leader Zhang Wei saw it, yanked the cloth out, and slapped the elderly woman backhanded, cursing her at the same time non-stop. This was a scene I saw with my own eyes.</p>
<p>在这种超负荷的劳动下，身体都难以承受了。有一天王淑芳想利用自己仅有的不到三个小时的睡觉时间想打一会儿坐来调节一下，还没坐稳就被大队长孙爱勤上厕所时发现，她到办公室取来钥匙开开门就一把把住在我邻床上铺的王淑芳拽下来，脱下鞋来一顿毒打。<br />This kind of overloaded labor was physically hard to bear. One day, Wang Shufang had less than three hours left to sleep, she wanted to use this time to meditate a while to amend her strength. As she was getting ready, Captain Sun Aiqin was going passed to the toilet room and saw Wang. The Captain fetched the key from her office, opened the door, dragged down Wang from the upper bunk next to me, took off the shoes, and beat her ferociously.</p>
<p>寇小坤是辽阳的法轮功学员，她就坐在我的对面干活，有一天她被警察霍艳叫出去不到半个小时就被带回来了，她被带回来时脸、嘴、鼻子和脖子都是水泡和青紫，衣服都是湿的。因为那里不让讲话，我们就跟聋哑人一样，无法问到她那半个多小时发生了什么，后来才知道，原来警察翻号时在她的床铺翻到了一篇名为《浅说善》的经文，警察霍艳把她带到大队长室时，大队长孙爱勤和四个小队长早已把电棍准备好等在那里，她告诉我说：大队长孙爱勤手拿那篇《浅说善》经文，原来警察翻号时在她的床铺翻到了一篇名为《浅说善》的经文（法轮功创始人李洪志先生写的一篇短文，这篇文章的连结: http://gb.falundafa.org/chigb/jjyz_45.md#1），警察霍艳把她带到大队长室时，大队长孙爱勤和四个小队长早已把电棍准备好等在那里，上来对她就是一顿拳打脚踢，其他队长也一拥而上，然后由四个队长把她的头摁在桌子上，大队长孙爱勤把那篇《浅说善》经文撕碎、泡在水杯里，由其中一个小队长往她的嘴里灌，孙爱勤大队长拿起电棍就电击她的嘴，边电边发疯似的问她经文是从哪里来的。寇小坤说那是一篇《浅说善》，请你看一看，孙爱勤根本不听，不说出经文是哪里来的就把电棍插到她的嘴里电，同时寇小坤还被四个队长摁着，她跟我说当时就感到人快要窒息了。<br />A Falun Gong practitioner Kou Xiaokun from Liaoyang was sitting across from me at work. One day, Guard Huo Yan called Kou away for some half an hour. When she came back, her face, mouth, nose and neck were all blistered and bruised, her clothes were all wet. Because conversation was not allowed there, like deaf-mute people, we could not ask her what had happened in that half an hour. We learned later that the guards found a Dafa article “A Brief Explanation of Shan” [the article by Li Hongzhi, founder of Falun Gong, can be read at http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/jjyz45.md#1] when they turned over her bed during a search. When Guard Huo took her to the Captain’s office, Captain Sun Aiqin and four other team leaders were waiting with electric batons. Kuo told me that, Captain Sun held the article “A Brief Explanation of Shan” in her hand, approached her quickly, and punched and kicked her. Four other team leaders also rushed up in a crowd and pressed her head on the desk, Sun tore the article “A Brief Explanation of Shan” into pieces and soaked it in a glass of water,. Then one of the team leaders poured it in her mouth. Captain Sun picked up an electric baton shocked her in the mouth while madly asking her where the article was from. Kou Xiaokun said it was the article “A Brief Explanation of Shan”, please read it. Sun didn’t want to hear that at all. She pocked an electric baton in her mouth ready to electric shock her if she did not tell where the article was from. At the same time Kou was still pressed down by the four team leaders. She told me she felt she was being suffocated to death right then and there.</p>

<p>有一次小谭琪背经文，被警察张威发现后叫到了办公室，对小谭琪拳打脚踢。小谭琪遭到毒打后，张威并没有甘休，竟然拿出做活的针，用针去扎她的胸部。她是一个不到十八周岁的少女，警察居然用针去扎她的胸部，上厕所时，小谭琪把胸部衣服撩起来让我们看，她的胸部有好多红色的针眼，有扎出血的痕迹。<br />Once a team leader, Zhang Wei, found out that little Tan Qi was reciting Dafa aure, she called her to the office, punched and kicked her. After brutally beating Tan, Captain Zang wasn’t willing to stop at that. She took out a knitting needle and stabbed Tan in the chest. The team leader went so far as to stab an under-18-year-old young girl! Little Tan pulled up her clothes to show us,. Her chest had lots of red pock holes with traces of blood.</p>
<p>辽阳的法轮功学员吕艳英，在铁岭法轮功学员到这之前，被这个教养院电棍插到嘴里电击。我们看到她时，她的脸有电击的伤痕，嘴唇上方还流着黄水。<br />Before Falun Gong practitioners arrived at Tieling Labor Camp, a Falun Gong practitioner, Lu Yanying from Liaoyang, was shocked in the mouth with an electric baton inserted into her mouth. When we saw her, her face had wounds from electric shock and yellow liquid dripping down from the top of her lips. </p>
<p>几个月来，辽阳教养院没有“转化率”，就到马三家“学习”。警察从马三家回来就强制我们轮流读诬蔑大法和大法师父的白皮书和看录影。我不读，恶警霍艳就把我叫到队长室毒打一顿。胡英、张艳，还有不满十八周岁的小谭琪因为不读，在我之前就被关进了小号。因为小号是临时为我们弄的，只能装下三个人，因为那里再也装不下第四个，我才躲过那场邪恶的迫害。<br />Because there was no &#8220;Transformation Rate&#8221; in Liaoyang Labor Camp for several months, the staff of the Camp went to Masanjia to learn. After coming back from Masanjia, they forced us to take turns to read the white book and watched tapes that slandered Falun Dafa and Falun Dafa’s Master. As I refused to read, a savage Guard, Huo Yan, called me to the Captain’s office and beat me up. At the time, Hu Ying, Zhang Yan, and little Tan Qi (under 18 years old) were already put in solitary confinement for refusing to read. Since the small cell was made at the last moment for us, it had room for three only, not the fourth, so I escaped the cruel persecution that time.</p>
<p>在小号里，恶警强迫她们整天双手抱膝坐着，不许动。当时正是夏天，把她们的屁股都坐烂了，流着脓血把裤衩都粘上了，上一次厕所就看她们要揭一次血痂。也不给吃饱饭，每次只给一小块苞米面饼子和几口苞米面粥。在小号里每天都给她们播放诬蔑大法的录音，她们所遭受的这一切迫害我们当时是能看到的，因为小号就在我们住的地方，是特意腾出的一个房间，这个小号房间被两个档板隔开，分别能装下三个人，每个非常狭小的小号里都有吊铐和地环，我们每次上厕所都会看到她们。她们这一被关进去，不“转化”，不写三书就不让出来了，后来张艳因为虚脱已坐不住，恶警们就把她大字型吊起来，就像耶稣被钉在十字架上一样，她的头已经无法抬起。当我看到这一幕时我的眼泪无法止住，我的心滴血般的难过。<br />In the solitary cell, the vicious guards forced them to sit still with arms around their legs. It was summer time, their bottoms were rotten from sitting and bled with pus sticking on the sides of their pants. Every time they took off their pants to excrete, the pants would peel off the scabs that had formed over their sores. They were not given enough food to eat, only a small piece of corn flour pancake, and a few sips of corn porridge at a time. In the cell, tapes slandered Dafa were played to them every day. We could see everything that happened to them because the solitary cell was in the building where we lived. The small cells were made from a room specifically cleared out and divided by two boards into three small solitary confinement units. ,could take three people separately, and all had hanging cuffs and floor rings. We could see them every time we went to the toilet. Once confined in the small room, one would not be released if not &#8220;transformed&#8221; or having signed &#8220;Three Statements.&#8221; (Note: The Three Statements: Practitioners are coerced under brainwashing and torture to write these as proof that they have given up their belief. The three statements consist of a letter of repentance, a guarantee to never again practice Falun Gong, and a list of names and addresses of all family members, friends and acquaintances who are practitioners, and, thus to betray their spiritual belief and their souls.) Later on, Zhang Yan collapsed, the evil guards hung her up with four limbs stretched out similar to Jesus being crucified on the cross, and she was already unable to lift her head. When I saw this picture, I couldn’t stop my tears, and my heart was so painful as if it was bleeding.</p>

<p>下面是铁岭的一位法轮功学员所见证的辽阳劳教所迫害经历链接：《我在铁岭劳教院、辽阳劳教院、沈阳监狱城遭受的残害》<br />The following is an experience of persecution in Liaoyang Forced Labor Camp witnessed by a Falun Gong practitioner, linking to “The cruel persecution I encountered in Tieling Labor Camp, Liaoyang Labor Camp, and Shenyang Prison.” (《我在铁岭劳教院、辽阳劳教院、沈阳监狱城遭受的残害》)</p>
<p>二零零零年九月，我、王东、王金萍、吕艳英被辽阳教养院扣上顽固的大帽子秘密押送到马三家劳教所迫害。<br />In September 2000, Liaoyang Labor Camp authorities labeled Wang Dong, Wang Jinping, Lu Yanying and me as stubborn and had us secretly escorted to Masanjia to be persecuted.</p>
<p><h2>四、罪恶的马三家</h2>
<p>4. The Sinful Masanjia</p>
<p>一九九九年的马三家教养院是为吸毒犯专门盖的戒毒所，建了一年多一直也没用上。因为一九九九年上访被非法劳教的辽宁法轮功学员特别多，这里就成了专门迫害“转化”法轮功学员的基地，也叫“集中营”，这里的警察是为了迫害法轮功而专门组建的，都是从女一所抽调的一些专门管刑事犯的女狱警，所长苏境原是女一所的所长。<br />In 1999, Masanjia was a drug rehabilitation center specifically built for drug addicts, but it was not used for more than a year after it was built. Because a lot of Falun Gong practitioners in Liaoning were illegally arrested in 1999 for petitioning, Masanjia became the base for forced “transformation” of Falun Gong practitioners and was also called a “Concentration Camp.” The guards here were organized specifically for persecuting Falun Gong practitioners. They were female guards drafted and transferred from No.1 Female Squad specialized in criminal offenders, and the Squad Captain, Su Jing, used to be the Captain of No.1 Female Squad.</p>
<p>马三家女所旁边就是男普教，男普教的六大队就在马三家正门的左侧后面，离女所不到二十米，是一趟平房，男普教的六大队是女所每天到食堂吃饭的必经之路，他们出操、出工、喊口号、唱歌，女所都能听到和看到。有时男犯人会帮着女所抬饭桶。当年所长苏境跟男队的队长都很熟，经常看到她与男所队长在操场上谈话，当年男所各大队也非法关押了好多男法轮功学员。<br />Next to the female part of Masanjia was a male prison cell, the No.6 Male Squad cell. It.was a flat located behind the left side of Masanjia’s main entrance, less than 20 meters away from the Female Squad. Alongside the Male No.6 Squad was the only path from the Female Squad to the canteen. Their drilling, working, chanting slogans, singing, etc. could all be heard and seen from the Female Squad. Sometimes, male inmates would help female carrying rice buckets. At the time, the Female Squad Captain, Su Jing, was familiar with the Male Squad Captains. We often saw her talking with Male Squad Captains on the parade ground. At the time, various Male Squads also imprisoned many male Falun Gong practitioners.</p>
<p>二零零零年九月，我与王东、王金萍、吕艳英四个被辽阳教养院扣上顽固的大帽子秘密押送到了这里。辽阳的王东、王金萍不知道给弄到了哪里，我和吕艳英被带到了二楼，二楼的大队长叫王乃民，四十多岁（此人后因迫害法轮功提升政委了），四分队的队长是张秀荣（六九年生，后因迫害法轮功提升大队长）。曝光马三家劳教院女二所迫害法轮功学员的恶警（续）</p>
<p>In September 2000, the four of us, Wang Dong, Wang Jinping, Lu Yanying and I, were labeled as stubborn, and secretly sent here, to the Masanjia Labor Camp. I didn’t know where they had sent Wang Dong and Wang Jinping from Liaoyong. Lu Yanying and I were taken to the second floor. The Captain of the second floor was forty some years old Wang Naimin (later on promoted to Political Commissar for persecuting Falun Gong practitioners). The No.4 Squad Captain was Zhang Xiurong (born in 1969, promoted to Brigade Captain later for persecuting Falun Gong practitioners.） Exposing Officials That Persecute Practitioners at the No. 2 Women’s Labor Camp of Masanjia Forced Labor Camp (Photos)</p>
<p>张秀荣把我带到大铁门的里边，叫来两个四防搜查我的行李和全身，然后又 把我带到办公室，她简单的了解了一下我个人的情况，然后叫来了两个包夹把我带到分队的室里，我到时，分队室里已有三十人了，两人一张床铺。张秀荣告诉我到马三家的法轮功学员必须都得“转化”，这里是劳教是专政机关，“转化率”已达到百分之百。<br />Captain Zhang Xiurong took me inside the big iron door and ordered two “inmate guards ” 〔the ordinary criminals including thieves and drug abusers whom the prison guards domineered and used as thugs to torture Falun Gong practitioners〕to search me and my luggage. Then took me to her office to briefly hear my situation and then had two “ personal monitors” (baojia) to take me to a Squad room.〔NOTE:&#8221;Baojia&#8221; are handpicked criminal inmates to persecute practitioners around the clock. The intent is to monitor and control Dafa practitioners, and assist guards in forcibly brainwashing Dafa practitioners. The guards often exert pressure and lure them with different benefits, forcing them to use all kinds of cruel means to torture Dafa practitioners.〕When I got there, there were already 30 people, two-to-a-bed. Captain Zhang told me that Falun Gong practitioners in Masanjia must all “transform,” this was a dictatorship institute of reeducation-through-labor, and the “transformation” rate had already reached 100%.</p>
<p>接下来的日子：我每天早晨不到五点就被包夹叫起来到厕所的门后面，强迫听犹大们游说到后半夜两点多。她们倒班说，嘴不停的说，我不明白她们说的嘴都冒白沫了为什么还说。我不理解她们被洗脑后的行为，听不懂也不理解她们被洗脑后的思想。她们在这里究竟发生了什么，为什么她们都说一样的话，都变成了与“真、善、忍”理念相反的人。一个月后，我知道了答案。<br />In the days that followed, I was awakened by a personal monitor (baojia) before 5a.m. every day, went behind the toilet room door and was forced to listen to collaborators 〔NOTE: Former Falun Gong practitioners who have turned against Falun Gong under brainwashing and torture. They are then made to assist in brainwashing and torturing Falun Gong practitioners. 〕They used persuadive talk all day until after 2 a,m. The guards changed shift and the new ones talked non-stop. I didn’t understand why they still kept on talking after their mouths were emitting froth. I didn&#8217;t understand their conduct after they were brainwashed. I didn&#8217;t understand their words and thoughts after being brainwashed. What had happened to them here? Why were their words all the same? They all became people opposed to the concept of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. A month later, I knew the answer.</p>
<p>半个月的洗脑，我没有被“转化”，张秀荣脱去了伪善的外衣，露出了狰狞的面目。她把我叫到了办公室，她叫四防把方木棍拿来，四防很熟练的把那个木棍子放在了我的双腿腿肚子上，然后张秀荣二话不说挥拳砸向我的头，一个窝心脚把我踹倒半坐在方木棍子上，然后让我半蹲夹着方木棍跟她讲话，如果棍子掉下来就用电棍电击我。我被这突如其来的变故弄的不知所措。她边拳打脚踢我边说：就你时间长，我们队是百分之百的“转化率”，就你没写三书，因为你，我的分队都进不来新人，今天你写也得写，不写也得写，就是写假的也得写。我说：我不懂什么叫三书，你身为警察随便打人你在执法犯法。她说，谁看见我打你了，你给我找出证人来。她见我不写，就气急败坏的叫人把我带到铁门外的一个空屋里，那里没有人，是专门酷刑法轮功学员的地方。她双手拿起桌上的两根大电棍直奔我杵来，边电边说：别敬酒不吃吃罚酒。<br />As I didn’t &#8220;transform&#8221; after half a month of brainwashing, Captain Zhang Xiurong removed her cover of hypocrisy and revealed her sinister face. She called me to the office, asked a “inmate guard ” to bring in a square wooden stick. The “inmate guard ” proficiently put the square wooden stick on my calf. Not saying anything further, Zhang punched my head with her fist, kicked me with her feet to make me sit on the square wooden stick, and then made me half squat listening to her. She would electric shock me if the stick fell. I didn’t know what to do with this abrupt misfortune. While punching and kicking me, Zhang said that I had withstood change the longest; that the “transformation” rate of the Squad she was in charge of had been 100%; that I was the only one who hadn’t signed the three-fold “Statement of Guarantee.” Because of me, she said, her Squad would not have new prisoners coming. Today, she said, like it or not, I had to sign, even faking it, I must sign. I said I didn’t know what the three-fold “Statement of Guarantee” was and that, as a guard beating people at will, she was breaking the law while enforcing it. Zhang said, “Who saw me beating you, find the witness for me.” She saw that I wouldn’t sign. Fustered and exasperated, she called people to take me to an empty house outside the iron gate. No one was there. It was a place customized for the brutal torture of Falun Gong practitioners. Zhang picked up two large electric batons, one in each hand, and headed directly toward me. While she electric shocked me, she told me not to “refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit.”</p>

<p>电棍劈啪的闪着刺眼的蓝光，电击着我的脸、脖子、手和脚。我的呼吸开始困难，脸开始抽搐，人已无法正常站立，身体虚弱的向下倒去……在极度的痛苦中，我的眼光开始对视这个生命，好像一切都静止了，她在我的面前突然变得非常的渺小，可怜和卑微。我心中想起了我的师父，想起了师父的教诲：“你要不能爱你的敌人，你就圆满不了。”那究竟是一种怎样的境界？我无暇去想圆满，怎样去爱这个电击我的人？她在迫害大法的信徒，她的生命将会去哪里？……我没有了痛苦的感觉，师父慈悲的能量灌透我的全身。窗外突然狂风四起雷声大作，天都黑黄了，震耳的雷声在窗前炸响，我完全没有了惧怕与痛苦，我郑重的告诉她我生命的最后一念都不会放弃法轮大法。她扔下了电棍破门而出。<br />With a cracking sound, the electric batons flashed blue light that was harsh to the eyes. She shocked me in the face, neck, hands and feet. I started breathing hard, my face started twitching, I could hardly stand upright, I was so weak that I gradually fell &#8230; In excruciating pain, I began to gaze at this life as if everything was at a standstill. Suddenly Captain Zhang appeared to be very, very small in front of me, pathetic and humble. I thought of my Master in my heart, thought of Master’s teaching, &#8220;If you are unable to love your enemies, then you cannot reach Consummation.&#8221; What kind of state that was! I had no time to think of consummation, how to love the person who electric shocked me? She was persecuting Dafa disciples, where was her life going? … I didn’t have the feeling of pain anymore, and the energy of Master’s compassion instilled my whole body. Suddenly, wicked wind began blowing wildly and thunder roared and rumbled outside the window and the sky turned dark yellow. Deafening thunder exploded right outside the window. I was completely free of fear and pain. I solemnly told Zhang I would not renounce Falun Dafa even if it was the last thought of my life. She dropped the electric batons, burst the door open and left.</p>
<p>四防把我拖回了监室，等我醒来，看到我的手、背、脸和脖子都是电焦的痕迹和水泡，人瘦的也不成样，身体极度虚弱。我静静的躺在那里感悟师父的教诲和容量，心中对师父充满了感激和无限的敬仰，因为师父在我遭受巨大痛苦时教会了我如何做人。<br />A &#8220;inmate guard&#8221;dragged me back to the cell. When I woke up I saw my hands, back, face and neck were all full of burn marks and blisters. I was as thin as could be and extremely weak. While lying quietly there, I came to realize Master’s teachings and capacity. My heart was filled with gratitude and immeasurable reverence toward Master because Master taught me how to be a human being when I was suffering enormous pain.</p>
<p>我身边的阿姨见我的身体已不成了样，就眼含泪水劝我说：孩子啊你能坚持就坚持住，在这里没有几个能挺过去的啊，实在坚持不住能写就写一个吧。我看着那些年迈的法轮功学员心就在想，原来她们就是这样被马三家“转化”的啊。我难过的流下了眼泪。<br />An older woman next to me saw that my body was damaged out of shape. She advised me in tears, &#8220;Child, be persistent if you are able but.not too many people here have been able to persevere. If you really can’t hold on anymore, sign it.&#8221; I looked at that elderly Falun Gong practitioner and thought in my heart, this is how they are &#8220;transformed&#8221; by Masanjia. I was so sad that I wept.</p>
<p>马三家的警察对“转化”的学员不放心是真的“转化”了，就威逼她们写一些诬蔑师父、诬蔑大法的东西，同时还逼迫她们在大小会上说大法不好的话，然后还逼她们给当地的公安局、派出所还有家里的人写信，就说炼法轮功错了，后悔了，等等。我看到那些受益于法轮大法曾经无病一身轻的学员，她们在写这个违心的东西时的内心痛苦。黑白颠倒、谎言的欺骗，我怎么能做这样的人？<br />Masanjia’s guards felt uncertain whether the &#8220;transformed&#8221; Falun Gong practitioners were indeed &#8220;transformed&#8221; so they coerced them to write things that slandered Master and things that slandered Dafa. They forced them to say bad things about Falun Gong in various meetings and then forced them to write to their local police station and to their families that it was wrong to practice Falun Gong, that they regretted it, etc. I saw the pain of those healthy practitioners, who benefitted by Falun Dafa, writing these things against their will, reversing black and white, lying to cheat. How could I be such a person?</p>
<p>虽然被非法关押到这里，作为人来讲，我不能去违心的说谎话。如果我在这里面因为承受不住迫害写出一份违心的“转化书”，马三家把它邮寄到我的家乡和公安局，那么它就会像一颗炸弹一样，炸向我的家乡，炸向我的亲人，他们会因为我的谎言而走到“真、善、忍”理念的对立面，那我的罪该有多大，所有参与的人的罪该有多大，要让全世界的人了解到法轮功的真实情况该有多不容易。当时就这样想，用生命去坚持不被洗脑，做一个人应该做的。<br />Although being illegally detained, as a human being I couldn&#8217;t lie against my will. If I signed the &#8220;Transformation Paper&#8221; against my will and it was mailed to my hometown and local police station, it would be like a bomb exploded in my hometown and family,.They would walk in the opposite direction to the principle of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance because of my lies. How great my sin would be then. How great the sin of all those who participated would be. How difficult it would be to make the whole world understand the truth of Falun Gong. This was the thought I had at that time. I used my life to persist, not to be brainwashed but to do what a human being should do.</p>
<p>因为我的不“转化”在影响着别人，张秀荣整天不让我睡觉，由一群包夹轮换着围攻我，最后把我交到了大队长王乃民那里。王乃民打人、电击人，很少让第二个人看到，进屋她就强制我蹲下，然后手拿两根电棍同时电我，问我为什么不写三书，这里是劳教是管制机关。我说我学法轮大法是自愿的，我不后悔，为什么要写悔过书，《转法轮》的作者没教我做坏事，你为什么叫我写揭批他的书，我揭批他什么？你不怕人家告你诬陷罪吗？你不怕，我怕。“我是被冤枉判‘扰乱公共秩序’进来的，你们教养院为什么跟我谈法轮功”你让我保证什么？我为什么要向别人保证什么。我们在这里是否有人权？警察打人是在执法犯法，同样是伤害罪。她说：你爱上哪上哪告去，你还想要人权呢？我被她电击十分钟左右，就又一次被抬回分队。我的身体被她们没日没夜的迫害已虚弱的不成人样了。她也怕我会死在她的电棍下。<br />Others were affected because I was not “transformed.” Captain Zhang Xiurong didn’t let me sleep all day long and ordered a group of “ personal monitors” (baojia) took turns to attack me from all sides. 〔NOTE:&#8221;Baojia&#8221; are handpicked criminals to persecute practitioners around the clock. The intent is to monitor and control Dafa practitioners, and assist guards in forcibly brainwashing Dafa practitioners. The guards often exert pressure and lure them with different benefits, forcing them to use all kinds of cruel means to torture Dafa practitioners.〕Finally I was Took to Brigade Captain Wang Naimin. Wang, who rarely let anyone see her beating or electric shocking people, forced me to squat as soon as I entered. She used two electric batons to shock me at the same time and asked me why I didn’t sign the three-fold “Statement of Guarantee.” She said, “This is a control institute of re-education-through-labor” [meaning that they were freer to use whatever means they needed to “transform” people.] I said, “I have learned Falun Dafa of my own free will. I don’t regret it. What reason do I have to write the “Repentance Statement.” The author of “Zhuan Falun” did not teach me to do bad things. Why do you ask me to write papers exposing and criticizing his book? What do I have to expose? Aren’t you afraid of being sued for the crime of entrapment? You are not afraid, but I would be if I were in your shoes. I am here because I was wrongly sentenced for the crime of ‘Disturbing the Public Order.’ Why does this Camp talk to me about Falun Gong? What do you want me to guarantee? Why should I guarantee anything to others? Don’t we have human rights here? Guards beating people is breaking the law while enforcing it,.It is a crime of aggravated assault whatever you say.” She said, “Go ahead wherever you like, sue! You even want human rights!” She electric shocked me for ten minutes or so. Once again I was carried back to the Squad. My body was extremely weak and out of shape from being persecuted day and night by them. She was afraid that I would die under her electric batons.</p>
<p>马三家不会放过一个不“转化”的法轮功学员。张秀荣最后急了，召集一群打手给她们开会。晚上把我留在厕所的门后面，包夹们已分好了班，四个人一班，两个小时一换。张秀荣下令不“转化”就别想回去睡觉。她们有拿木棒的，有拿大号螺丝刀的，有拿针的，都准备好了。秦元清、魏宏伟，还有两个邪悟的，上来对我就一顿打，别的室的打手们过来五～六个帮她们打，秦元清和魏宏伟把我的头往墙上撞。我的脑袋耳朵被他们打得嗡嗡的响，整个走廊都听得到那可怕的声音。她们的嘴不停的骂大法，骂师父骂下流话，逼我写“转化书”。<br />Masanjia would not let any Falun Gong practitioners who were not “transformed” get away. In the end, Captain Zhang Xiurong became so anxious that she gathered a group of thugs and held a meeting with them. In the evening, they left me behind the toilet room door [where no-one could see what happened]. Several “ personal monitors” (baojia) had been assigned, four in a shift, two hours each shift. Zhang gave the order:no “transformation,” no sleep. The thugs were all ready; some held wooden sticks, some held large screwdrivers, some held needles, etc. Qin Yuanqing, Wei Hongwei, and two “transformed” ones with crooked understanding of Dafa, approached and beat me. Five or six thugs from other rooms came to help them beat me. Qin and Wei bashed my head into the wall. My head and ears had buzzing sound from the beating, and the terrible beating sound could be heard in the entire corridor. They also kept on cursing Dafa and Master with vulgar words trying to force me to sign the &#8220;Transformation Paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>后半夜，她们打累了就让我的手伸平，腿半蹲站着，旁边有人拿着纸和笔，逼写三书。我的手背被魏宏伟的右手手指甲掐起放下，她的左手拿着做活的针放在我的腕下，等着被她掐起落下的手腕，她们就这样掐着我手背上的皮提起来放下去，提起来放下去，来回扎，没到两个小时的时间，我的手背被她们掐成馒头状，腕下被针扎得血肉模糊。我把手挪开，她们就用木棍子，还有螺丝刀打我、捅我，魏宏伟抡起手拚命地扇打我的嘴巴子，扇我的脸，我脑子被她多次扇得嗡嗡响。她的嘴不停的在半夜里说着阴阳怪气的话：“你知道吗？我已经等了你一千五百多年了”。她的话让我在剧痛杂乱中安定下来，我吃力地睁开肿得只有一条缝的眼睛，静静的看着她们，再也感受不到针扎、拳头、木棍、螺丝刀击打我的痛。看着她们被马三家洗脑后可怜而又可怕的表演，我的心在滴血，为她们流下了无法止住的泪水。我难过至极。我在心里不停地喊着：师父，师父，我对她们无怨无恨。（我被他们毒打逼迫“转化”时，苏境、王乃民、张秀荣都到厕所“审查”过，苏境、王乃民那时大小会都会讲：国家对法轮功是一场没有硝烟的战争，投资的经费相当于一场国际战争，等等等等。）<br />Late at night, as they were tired from beating me, they forced me to stretch my arms out in front with legs half crouched. Others held a pen and paper next to me and tried to force me to sign the three-fold “Statement of Guarantee.” Wei Hongwei used her right hand finger nails pinched to lift up the back of my hand then let go while her left hand held a needle under my arm such that my arm would drop on the needle. With this pinching to lift up and letting go to drop on the needle, in less than two hours the back of my hands were swollen like a steamed bun, and the undersides of my wrists were badly mangled and mutilated from the needle piercing. If I moved my hands, they would use wooden sticks and screwdrivers to hit and poke me. Wei whirled her hands and slapped me hard on the mouth and face. My head had a buzzing sound from this repeated slapping. She made statements out of the blue repeatedly throughout the night: &#8220;Do you know? I&#8217;ve been waiting for you for more than 1,500 years.&#8221; Her words enabled me to calm down from acute pain and messy thoughts. I strenuously opened my badly swollen eyes with only two slits left, and watched them quietly. I no longer felt the pain from needle piercing nor the beatings by fists, sticks, and screwdrivers. Watching their pathetic and terrible behaviors after being brainwashed by Masanjia, my heart bled. I shed unstoppable tears for them, I was very sad. I kept on shouting in my heart, “Master, Master!” I held no grudges against them. (When I was brutally beaten in an attempt to coerce me into“transformation,” Su Jing, Wang Naimin, and Zhang Xiurong had all been inthe toilet room. At the time, Su Jing and Wang Naimin would say in all meetings, large or small, that it was a war of the State against Falun Gong without gun smoke, the invested funds were equivalent to an international war, etc.)</p>
<p>那时全国各地教养院都要来马三家学习“转化”经验，省领导也会来。第二天张秀荣就命包夹们把我藏了起来。<br />During this period, all Labor Camps around the country came to Masanjia to learn the “transformation” experience, even provincial leaders came. The next day, Zhang Xiurong asked a “personal inmate” (bao jia) to hide me [while a visit took place.]</p>
<p>视察结束后，张秀荣让几个四防和大小室长把我拖到办公室，逼我写“转化书”，我不写，她伙同另外两个恶警队长打我羞辱我，逼我“转化”，写三书，我不写，张秀荣气急败坏地拿来剪子，上来就把我的头摁在地上剪我的头发，看剪得不到位就又把剪子给了四防，四防又接着剪，她们边骂边打边剪，我的头发被剪得男女不分。然后张秀荣狂笑着说这才像精神病呢？然后让一群打手围着我说，你看她炼法轮功炼得脸色这么不好，都炼出精神病来了。那时马三家进来好多新来的，因为我没“转化”就把我弄成这样吓唬别人，说我炼出精神病来了。<br />After the visitors left, Captain Zhang Xiurong ordered several” inmate guards” and various room leaders to drag me to the office to force me to sign the three-fold “Statement of Guarantee.” When I refused, she and two other vicious guards beat me up and humiliated me and tried to force me to “transform” and to sign the three-fold “Statement of Guarantee.” I refused again. Flustered and exasperated, Zhang Xiurong took a pair of scissors, approached me and pressed my head on the floor and cut my hair. As she felt she was not cutting sufficiently, she passed the scissors to a “inmate guard” to continued the cutting. They cursed while cutting. My hair was cut in such a messy way that one could not tell whether I was a man or a woman. Then, Zhang Xiurong laughed wildly and said: “This is what a mental patient looks like!” And then a bunch of thugs surrounded me and said that I looked so pale and had become psychotic because of practicing Falun Gong. At the time, Masanjia had many newcomers. I was made to look like this to scare them. They were told I had a mental disorder from Falun Gong cultivation.</p>
<p>当年那里对强迫“转化”后的学员是半天洗脑学习半天劳动，我几乎就没有“享受”过这个待遇，整天被拉出去迫害。每天精神都处在了恍惚的状态，身体已极度虚弱，没有了人的样子。我想起了我年幼的儿子，如果我被她们害死，我可怜的孩子该怎么办？<br />In those days, practitioners being coerced to “transform” worked half the day and attended brainwash-learning the other half of the day. I had never “enjoyed” this treatment but was dragged out to be persecuted all day long. I was in a trance every day, was physically extremely weak and looked hardly like a person. I thought of my young son, what was this poor child going to do if I was persecuted to death.</p>
<p>我的妈妈打来了电话。一天张秀荣把我叫到了办公室，让我接电话，这是我被非法关押一年来第一次与家人通话，妈妈在电话的那一头崩溃式地哭喊着让我快写个悔过书快回家，你爸出车祸人事不省了，在医院里抢救，外地亲属都来了，快回来见他最后一面吧，边说边号啕大哭，妈好不容易才打进来的电话啊，院长不批妈都不知你是死是活了，这日子没法过了。电话那头的妈妈已泣不成声。这时的张秀荣可抓住了机会，拿来了桌上的纸和笔让我赶快写悔过书，我说我不后悔，我为什么要写悔过书。<br />My mother called. One day, Zhang Xiurong called me to the Office to take the phone call. That was the first time I had spoken to my family in one year’s illegal imprisonment. My mother on the other end of the line fell apart and cried, asked me to quickly sign the paper of repentance and come home. She said my father had an accident and had been unconscious and was hospitalized for emergency rescue. Relatives from out of town all came to pay their last visits to him. My mother cried bitter tears while talking about it. She then said that it was very hard to get the call through. If the department head hadn’t approved, she said she would not even know if I was still alive. &#8220;It is so hard to live like this day after day,&#8221; my mother lost her voice crying. Zhang took this opportunity to put the paper and a pen on the table and asked me to quickly sign the &#8220;Repentance Statement.&#8221; I said I did not regret so why was she asking me to sign the &#8220;Repentance Statement.&#8221;</p>
<p>回到分队，张秀荣召集全队的人开会，说法轮功就是如何没有亲情，都不要家了，她妈哭成那样她都不管。面对这场迫害带来的家庭变故， 对她的话我再也没法忍耐。我当众大声说：到底谁是邪教，是谁把我们控制到这里来的，是谁不让我们要家人，我的父亲现在死活不知，到底谁把我们关在这，断我们的亲情，天天精神控制我们。法轮功想学就学，不想学没人强逼着学。张秀荣的脸都被气青了，叫来四防把我又拽到大队长室，当着王乃民和邱萍的面上来就照着我的肚子狠踹几脚，然后打我的头和脸。当时我就感到头晕、眼花、恶心，小肚子剧痛直不起腰来，大队长王乃民过来说我装的，后来看我的脸变了颜色，张秀荣才住手。因我的孩子是剖腹产，留下的那个刀口被张秀荣那几脚踹得仿佛裂开一般的剧痛，不来月经的我下身被她踹得流出了血。<br />Back at the Squad (No.4 Squad), Zhang Xiurong gathered the whole team for a meeting, telling how Falun Gong had no affection for family, didn’t even want to have a family, how my mother had cried like that yet I didn&#8217;t care. Facing the family misfortune brought on by the persecution, I was unable to take Zhang’s talk any longer. I said loudly to the crowd: “Who is the evil cult after all? Who forced us here? Who didn’t let us see our family? Who kept me from knowing whether my father was alive? Who kept me here? Who cut off our family love? Who mentally controlled us every day? One learned Falun Gong of one’s own free will, no one forced anyone to learn.&#8221; Zhang was so mad that her face turned blue. She called a &#8220;inmate guard&#8221; to drag me to the Captain&#8217;s office again,. In front of Qiu Ping and Wang Naimin, Zhang kicked my stomach a number of times then hit my head and face. I felt dizzy and vomited. My lower abdomen was in such acute pain that I couldn’t straighten my back. The Brigade Captain Wang Naimin came over and said I was faking it. Zhang stopped only after she saw my face was discolored. My child was born with cesarean section. The incision left from it was in such sharp pain from the kicking it felt as if it had been split open. My genital area was bleeding I did not menstruate so I knew it was from the kicking.</p>
<p>从二零零零年的十月以后，多了刚来的赵素环，她被迫害得更加惨烈。三分队的邹桂荣、苏菊珍她们身上都没见过没有伤的时候，那时半夜里经常听到苏菊珍被电击的惨烈叫声，邹桂荣常被带出来羞辱游斗。赵素环笔下记录马三家迫害她的纪实，见《马三家画皮背后的狰狞—— 一位大法弟子用鲜血写出的事实真相》<br />Zhao Suhuan arrived after October 2000, and was persecuted even more brutally. The bodies of Zou Guirong and Su Juzhen of No.3 Squad were never seen without wounds. At that time, Su Juzhen’s screaming from electric shock was often heard in the middle of the night, and Zou Guirong was often taken out to be humiliated, criticized, and beaten by the prisoners. For therecord of Zhao Suhuan’s persecution in Masanjia written by herself, see,<br />http://www.clearwisdom.net/emh/articles/2004/5/19/48270.md#1<br />&#8220;The Savagery Behind the Evildoers&#8217; Disguises at the Masanjia Labor Camp&#8221; facts written by a Dafa disciple with blood.</p>
<p>二零零一年的三月十六日不知为什么马三家买了好多体育用品挂在墙上，全所打扫卫生，手工活都放到楼下的库房里，停止了所有的迫害活动。早上八点多钟张秀荣拿著名单点到谁谁就出来，然后说分期分批去看电影，电影的名字是“抉择”，我们室三十二人点出十六人，然后被带到一辆大客车上。这次行动是全院统一的，别的队也是这样，上车的都是没有“转化”的法轮功学员和包夹她们的劳教人员。这样的学员从马三家拉到少管所共三辆大客车。我们到了马三家的少管所被关在大食堂里面。不是电影院。晚上才被拉回马三家。后来才知道那次的调离是因为马三家来了外国记者。<br />On March 16, 2000, for unknown reasons, Masanjia bought a lot of sports goods that were hung on the wall. The entire building was cleaned and sanitized,. All manual work products were moved to the storeroom downstairs. All persecution was stopped. A little after 8 a.m., Zhang Xiurong took out a name list. Those called out were divided into groups to watch movies in turns. The movie’s name was &#8220;Choice.&#8221;16 of the 32 in our room were called and taken to a large bus. This action was campwide, the same took place in the other camps. Those on the bus were Falun Gong practitioners who were not &#8220;transformed.&#8221; They were flanked by the reeducation-through-labor personnel. There were three large buses taking these practitioners from Masanjia to a Youth Detention Center where we were herded into the canteen. It wasn’t a movie theater. We were brought back to Masanjia in the evening. We learned later that we were taken away because foreign reporters were visiting.</p>
<p>二零零零年的十月记不得是哪一天，中央电视台〈焦点访谈〉记者采访马三家女二所时，采访了我。当时我不知道为什么突然把我从厕所的门后叫回室。后来才知道中央电视台〈焦点访谈〉记者李玉强（就是采访自焚伪案刘思影的那个）要采访一个没有“转化”的法轮功学员。她的后面是一个青年男子，肩上扛个录影机，对着我就录，然后李玉强面带微笑手里拿着麦克风走到我面前，问：你好！你是没有“转化”的法轮功学员吗？我说：你好！是。她手拿麦克风对着我又问：你相信神佛的存在吗？我反问她：你相信空气的存在吗？你相信电话没线能通话吗？你相信因为修炼法轮功在这里被残酷的迫害吗？她没有回答，带着她的录影师转身离去。<br />One day in October, 2000, I can&#8217;t remember the date, when the Central Television Station of Chinese Communist Television (CCTV) sent focus interview reporters to No.2 Female Camp of Masanjia, I was interviewed. At that time, I didn’t know why I was suddenly called back from behind the toilet room door but I learned later that a CCTV reporter, Li Yuqiang (the one who interviewed Liu Siying of the self-immolation case) [For more information on this, seehttp://en.minghui.org/cc/88/ .] requested to interview a Falun Gong practitioner who was not “transformed.” Behind her was a young man carrying a video recorder on his shoulder taping me,.Li Yuqiang, holding the microphone in her hand, came up to me with a smile and asked, “Hello! You were a Falun Gong practitioner not “transformed” right?” I said, “Hello! Yes.” Still with the microphone in her hand, she asked, “Do you believed in the existence of God?” I asked her in return, “Do you believe in the existence of air? Do you believe telephone conversations could get through without wires? Do you believe there is a brutal persecution here for practicing Falun Gong?” She didn’t answer and left with her cameraman.</p>
<p>下面是邹桂荣笔下纪录下来她所见到李玉强的那一幕，摘自明慧网：《我在马三家教养院的遭遇》<br />The following is taken from Minghui.org. It was written by Zou Guirong recording the scene with Li Yuqiang that Zou witnessed, it is on the Chinese website that translates into English: &#8220;What I Encountered in Masanjia Labor Camp.&#8221; (《我在马三家教养院的遭遇》)</p>
<p>“在十月中旬，中央电视台〈焦点访谈〉记者采访马三家女二所时，我们三楼三分队和一分队的大法学员被支出去倒煤，当我们满身黑尘回来时，中央电视台记者正在我所在室内采访那些叛徒，我们二分队八名坚定的大法学员被关到水房和厕所告知不许出来，即使身上黑灰洗漱完，衣服洗干净也得在水房呆着，并且由叛徒们看着，互相之间不让说话。这是邱萍的命令，这次采访就是中央电视台〈焦点访谈〉演的邱萍警察如何关心学员，给学员衣服穿。邱萍为什么不谈在我丈夫给我送衣服时她一口回绝，拒之门外呢？邱萍及其马三家教养所女警察所导演的一出出骗人的把戏哄得了一时，哄不了一世。昨天邱萍又用欺骗的方式向全国百姓阐明马三家劳教所没有打骂学员，殊不知她就是指使学员并亲自动手打学员最残忍的警察，她现在还在继续欺骗世人，邪恶至极。”<br />&#8220;In mid-October, when CCTV focus interview reporters interviewed the No. 2 Women’s Labor Camp of Masanjia Forced Labor Camp, Falun Gong practitioners of the No.3 and No.1 Divisions on the third floor were outside moving coal. When we returned with black dust all over us, CCTV reporters were interviewing betrayers in the room where I was. Eight of us who were determined Falun Gong practitioners in No.2 Division were confined in the wash room and toilet room and not permitted to come out. We were to stay in the wash room even after the black dust was scrubbed off our bodies and our clothes cleaned; and we were watched by the collaborators [former Falun Gong practitioners who have gone astray due to brainwashing and torture] to ensure we did not talk to each other. This was Qiu Ping’s orders. This interview by CCTV (focus interview) was a show to tell how Qiu Ping’s guards cared for practitioners and provided them with clothes. Why didn’t Qiu Ping tell them how she rejected my husband when he brought me clothes? This series of shows directed by Qiu Ping and her Masanjia female guards could fool others temporarily but not forever. Yesterday, Qiu used deceptive ways to give the impression to people in the country that Masanjia had not beaten or scolded practitioners. Few could imagine that she has been the most brutal one who beat up and threatened practitioners. How evil is that that she still continues lying to the world now.&#8221; </p>
<p>李玉强她参加了马三家在二零零一年一月十七日女所对“法轮功政策的兑现大会”。为了向外界显示其所谓的“转化成果”，“马三家”举办了第五次所谓的“政策兑现大会”。当时辽宁省省委书记闻世震等省级官员和多家媒体出席了那次会议。那次大会把马三家“劳教所”改变成了“辽宁省马三家思想教育学校”，牌子上有闻世震的名字。闻世震在那次大会上发了言，肯定了马三家警察的转化“成绩”。参加大会的有辽宁和各个省市的电视台，“天安门自焚伪案”中央电视台那个记者李玉强就在其中。当时有很多录影机的镜头对着录那次大会。有几百人参加。当时三分队的王春英代表解教人员在台上发言，当时她被邪恶的马三家“转化”了，成了她们的打手和帮凶（回家后听说她又清醒了），当她讲“马三家这里面‘春风化雨、警察像妈妈一样，这里没有迫害发生’时，法轮功学员邹桂荣在台下突然站起来指责她说：“你在撒谎！”<br />Li Yuqiang participated in the Masanjia Female Division’s &#8220;Falun Gong Policy Fulfilling Convention&#8221; on January 17, 2001. In order to show the outside world the so-called&#8221;Transformation Achievement,&#8221; &#8220;Masanjia&#8221; held the fifth so-called &#8220;Policy Fulfilling Convention.&#8221; At the time, Secretary of Liaoning Province Wen Shizhen, provincial level officials and several media participated in that Convention. That Convention changed “Masanjia Labor Camp” to “Liaoning Province Masanjia Ideology Education School,&#8221; the name plate had Wen&#8217;s name on it. Wen spoke at the Convention, affirmed Masanjia guards’ &#8220;accomplishments&#8221; of “transformation.” TV stations from Liaoning and various provinces participated in the Convention. The CCTV reporter Li Yuqiang who interviewed the &#8220;Tiananmen forged self-immolation case&#8221; was among them. At the time, a lot of video cameras taped that Convention, and a few hundred people attended. Wang Chunying of No.3 Squad was “transformed” by the evil Masanjia and turned into their thug and accomplice (it was heard that she awakened after returning home.) At that time, she spoke on the podium, representing ex-convicts. When she said, “Over here in Masanjia, it is the ‘spring breeze and rain’ type of education, guards are like mothers, there are no persecutions here,” Falun Gong practitioner Zou Guirong in the audience stood up pointing a finger at her and said, “You are lying!”</p>
<p>话音还没落，邹桂荣就被一群警察和打手围上按倒在地。当时坐在台上的闻世震和省里及马三家的院长十几个领导同时都站了起来。邹桂荣被带走了。《我在马三家教养院的遭遇》这篇文章里纪录了她被带走后的遭遇。<br />Wen Shizhen (Party secretary of Liaoning province), provincial level officials, the Head of Masanjia, and more than 10 other leaders all stood up at the same time. Before she finished the sentence, she was pressed down on the floor by a group of guards and thugs. Zou was carried away. The article &#8220;What I Encountered in Masanjia Labor Camp&#8221; （《我在马三家教养院的遭遇》）recorded what happened to her after being taken away. </p>
<p>当时很多录影机都在对着主席台录影，突然的变故主席台上的人都很意外和尴尬地站了起来。录影师和记者们马上回过神来，把录影机掉转了方向，急忙快速地跑过去，十几台各大媒体的录相机，同时录下了邹桂荣被摁倒，被拽着头发，被一群男女警察押走的那一幕。<br />When this happened, many video recorders were aimed at the platform. Suddenly the people on the platform all stood up awkwardly because of the commotion. Photographers and reporters immediately stopped this focus and turned their recorders in another direction and quickly ran over there. Already more than ten media had taped the scene of Zou being pressed down, dragged by the hair and being taken away by the group of male and female guards.</p>
<p>当时我们被迫害严重的法轮功学员都被身边的包夹摁住。会场一片混乱，马三家的恶警们全都气势汹汹惊恐万分。面对这突如其来如此尴尬的场面，台上站出个不知名的男领导，拿着麦克风出来打圆场，对着台下说：刚才那个是法轮功的“顽固分子”，不要被其影响。大会草草结束。<br />At the same time, we, the severely persecuted Falun Gong practitioners, were all held still by the “ personal monitors” (baojia) around us. The meeting hall was in chaos, Masanjia’s evil guards were all extremely truculent and in panic. Facing this sudden awkward situation, an unknown male leader got on the platform, took a microphone and, to smooth things over, he told the audience that it was a “stubborn” Falun Gong practitioner just now, and not to be influenced by it. The Conference ended hastily.</p>
<p>当年有十几家电视台的录影机录到了这一幕，我还没有看到有人站出来。希望心存正义的录影师，把你当年的录影拿出来，再让我们看一眼那个为了坚持宇宙真理而被中共虐杀身亡的邹桂荣。<br />Although more than ten TV stations taped what went on, I hadn’t seen any of the footage. I hope some just photographers will review the scene taped at the time and let have another glance at Zou Guirong who was persecuted to death by the CCP for upholding the truth of the universe.</p>
