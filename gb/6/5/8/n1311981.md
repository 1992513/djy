	<p>【大纪元5月8日讯】编者按：六四后流亡海外的原北京四通总裁万润南与中共总书记胡锦涛曾在清华大学有学友关系。本文回忆二人同学相知后来分道扬镳的往事，是一份珍贵的史料。 </p>

<p></center></p>
<p>胡锦涛是我的学长。四十年前，我们同在清华文艺社团，作为集中队员，我们吃在同一个食堂、住在同一栋宿舍、组织生活在同一个支部，有过一段相当亲密的接触。听到他在耶鲁演讲开篇的一段话，别有一番感慨在心头。他说： </p>
<p>“进入耶鲁大学的校园，看到莘莘学子青春洋溢的脸庞，呼吸著书香与空气，我不禁想起四十年前在北京清华大学度过的美好时光，学生时代对于人的一生都会产生重要影响。当年，老师们对我的教诲，同学们给我的启发，我至今仍受用不尽。” </p>
<p><B>文艺社四名政治辅导员中的大帅</B></p>
<p>老师们的教诲，首先是蒋南翔校长的教诲。我们刚进学校，在迎新会上，蒋校长就教诲我们：“清华培养的学生，要在二十年后的国家政治生活中起骨干作用。”当时我们很不理解，现在我们有点明白了。耶鲁三百多年来培养出了包括五名总统在内的许多英才，清华二十年内培养出了包括胡锦涛在内同时上岗的四名政治局常委，就单位时间的产出而言，清华还更胜一筹。 </p>
<p>蒋校长是如何做到这些的？主要是在培养学生干部时采用“政治辅导员”制度。当年文艺社团有四名辅导员：印甫盛、胡锦涛、李桂秋、任丽翰。他们当中，印和李冷峻、胡和任温柔，他们的共同特点是：听话、出活。他们的昵称很有意思：那三位同他们的姓名有关，分别叫老印、李桂、小翰，只有胡锦涛，大家叫他“大帅”。为什么称他“大帅”？我曾请教过老印，他也说不清楚。看来这个名字叫对了。从文艺社团的“大帅”，到共青团的“大帅”、贵州省的“大帅”、西藏自治区的“大帅”，一直到全国的“大帅”。 </p>
<p>但从当时文艺社团的四位辅导员来看，表面上老印更像“大帅”。他们四人当中，老印是支部书记，一把手；胡是团长，二把手。他们配合得很好。老印这个人很强势，说一不二；胡却谦虚随和、善解人意。开会的时候，定调做总结的，是老印；补充说明、完善细节、思路缜密的，是胡锦涛。 </p>
<p>文革初期，他们四位辅导员联名写了一张保卫校党委的大字报，题目是“清华党委是延安、不是西安”。也是由印来主导，胡只是在上面签名。后来清华文革中的一些重大事件，老印都有所涉及；胡却非常低调，不再参与。老印的支持者和反对者壁垒分明；胡却基本上没有反对他的人，谦逊、平和、与人为善，使他广结人缘。论长相，老印与胡锦涛一个黝黑英俊、目光锐利；一个白净端正、温文尔雅。刚者易折，柔能克刚，所以最后胡锦涛一路过关斩将，成就了真正的“大帅”。 </p>
<p><B>同胡锦涛南下串联沿江而下</B></p>
<p>但在当时，做事情，我更愿意跟着老印；业余活动，我更愿意跟着胡。文革期间，写大字报、搞战斗组，我都跟老印在一起；外出串联、游山玩水，我就同胡在一起。我一共串联过两次，一次是独来独往，从北京 －－ 广州 －－ 海南岛 －－ 湛江 －－ 南宁 －－ 桂林 －－ 上海；另一次是同胡锦涛，我们两个人一起从北京 －－ 西安 －－ 成都 －－ 重庆，然后一起乘船从重庆沿江而下。一路上我们很少谈文革，而是沉迷在沿途的景观：西安的古朴；成都的繁华、重庆的山城、三峡的险峻、大江的辽阔 &#8230;&#8230; 他在南京下船，应该是回了泰州老家；我则是在上海下船，也是回家看看。一路上，都是他照顾我。他出面安排一切，又让你感觉受到了尊重，很细心也很周到，处处让你觉得舒服。 </p>
<p>胡锦涛是水利系五字班的，应该在一九六五年毕业。因为当政治辅导员，按规定延后一年毕业。这一延就到了文革，所以一直拖到一九六八年才离校。记得他是分配到甘肃刘家峡。离京前，他请老印和我吃了顿饭。老印说要敲他一下，点了晋阳饭庄。我是第一次进北京的大饭店。晋阳饭庄的店址原来是纪晓岚的书斋“阅微草堂”。院宇幽静深邃，梁柱雕漆描画，号称正宗山西味、京都第一家。我很喜欢纪晓岚的《阅微草堂笔记》，所以在这里吃饭，还能感到一种书香。记得那天还喝了点小酒，三人不胜唏嘘，因为今日一别，就是“明日隔山岳，世事两茫茫”了。 </p>
<p>这一别，就是十四年。一九八二年，他从甘肃省建委的任上调中央党校学习，我当时已在中科院计算中心上班。他从火车站乘公共汽车到党校报到。途经三三二路黄庄车站，他特地下车和我匆匆会了一面。后来他到团中央工作，各方反映和口碑都不错，我也莫名奇妙地觉得与有荣焉。 </p>
<p>再一晃又是五年。一九八七年民办科技实业家协会在贵阳开会，我创办的“四通”已小有名气。他正在贵州省当书记，约了时间去拜访他。会客室温馨而简朴，比我那个已经十分简朴的总裁办公室还要简朴。他还是那样谦和谨慎，谈话中能感到他同省里方方面面的关系都相处得不错，这是他的强项。省科委的人在边上作陪，聊了一些科技发展规划和科技企业的事情。临走时，特地让我带走两瓶茅台。我相信，这两瓶一定是真货。 </p>
<p><B>八九之后人生轨迹趋于两极</B></p>
<p>然后就是一九八九年的政治风波，从此我们的人生轨迹趋于两极。但在我内心深处，还是默默地祝福他。先是祝福他能顺利接班，然后是祝福他能有所作为。当有消息说他曾派人去欧洲了解社会民主党的发展情况、刚上台组织政治局学宪法、面对 SARS 的施虐公开出来讲话，力排众议纪念胡耀邦，都让人对他燃起某种希望。然而，关于学古巴、北朝鲜的讲话，又让人极度失望。 </p>
<p>其实希望和失望，都是我自身的问题，同他并没有什么关系。佛家禅宗有言，是心动，而不是旗动。他还是那个在共产党体系里“听话、出活”的胡锦涛。我毕竟还是凡心未泯，最近一连写了三篇文章：《和共产党分道扬镳》、《为什么共产党气数未尽》和《山坳上的共产党》，一是对已逝的长者的悼念，二是对自身思路的梳理，三也是对在朝在野双方的建言。至于别人是否听得进去，那就不是我能关心的问题了。 </p>
<p>今后我大概不会再写此类文章。那么多人在写，并不缺我这一个。我想写点自己想写、也只有我能写的东西：说我自己的故事。我计划写大约一百篇《清华岁月》、一百篇《四通故事》、一百篇《流亡生涯》。算是对自己的一生有一个交代。 </p>
<p>有人读了我最近的文章，说：“万润南，你大概是不想回去了？”是的，除了我年过八十的老父老母，那边已没有什么是我可牵挂的了。前一段，母亲急性肺炎连续发高烧摄氏三十九度六，医院发了病危通知。许多至诚的朋友帮忙安排我回去。我也说得很明白：违心的话，我是不会讲的。这个年龄了，我也不想委屈自己了。虽然没有结果，但是朋友的情谊，我是点点滴滴，都在这里心领了。 </p>
<p><p>My College Upper Classman , Hu Jintao</p>
<p>By Wan Runnan </p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s Note: The author was personally acquainted with Hu Jintao, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, when both were students at Beijing &#8216;s Tsinghua University . Mr. Wan later became president of Beijing-based Stone Corp. before fleeing into exile after the “June 4 th” incident of 1989. Here he writes of his friendship with Hu during their college years before each eventually went his own way. This is a valuable historical piece for the study of the fourth generation of Chinese communist leaders.</p>
<p>Hu Jintao was my upper classman when we were both students at Tsinghua University . Forty years ago, we belonged to the same culture and arts group on campus, and as such dined in the same cafeteria, lived in the same dormitory, and took part in activities of the same branch of the Communist Youth League. We were quite close during that period. So listening to the speech he gave at Yale University recently raised some peculiar emotions in me. </p>
<p>Hu said: “Coming to the Yale campus, with its distinctive academic flavor, and looking at the eager young faces in the audience, I cannot but recall my great experience studying at Tsinghua University in Beijing 40 years ago. Indeed, what happens during one&#8217;s school year will influence his whole life. I still benefit greatly from the instruction and my interaction with other students.”</p>
<p>The Top Political Counselor of the Cultural and Arts Group<br />Among the teachings of our professors, most important were those of university president Jiang Nanxiang. In the welcoming party for freshmen, president Jiang told us, “Students educated at Tsinghua will play an important role in the political life of our country 20 years later.” I did not understand what he meant then, but I have come to understand it better now. </p>
<p>In her 300 years of history, Yale has produced many members of the elite, among them five presidents of the United States . But in 20 years, Tsinghua produced four members of the current Standing Committee of the Politburo, including Hu Jintao. From the standpoint of timing, Tsinghua exhibits a better efficiency. </p>
<p>How did president Jiang Nanxiang achieve this? Mainly by using a system of “political counselors” to train student cadres. At the time I was there, the student cultural and arts group had four counselors: Yin Fusheng, Hu Jintao, Li Guiqiu and Ren Lihan. Among them, Yin and Li were cold and remote, and Hu and Ren more personable. But they all had something in common: obedience and efficiency. Their nicknames were indicative of their roles and characters: Three were given a nickname based on their names: Lao Yin (meaning Old Yin), Li Gui, and Xiao Han (meaning Little Han). Only Hu Jintao was called “Commander.” Why was he addressed this way? I once asked Lao Yin. He said he had no idea. But it now seems this nickname was accurate. Hu rose from “Commander” of the student cultural and arts group to “Commander” of the Youth League of the communist party, then to Commander of Guizhou Province and the Tibetan Autonomous Region, and now of the whole country. </p>
<p>But among the four counselors of the cultural and arts group at the time, Lao Yin had the most superficial resemblance to a “Commander.” Among the four, Lao Yin was the branch secretary, or top leader. Hu was the group leader, that is, second in command. The two of them worked together very well. Lao Yin was a strong and single-minded leader, while Hu was modest and easy-going, understanding and considerate. When they conducted meetings, it was Lao Yin who drew the line and summed things up, while Hu filled in the blanks and meticulously finalized the details. </p>
<p>During the early days of the Cultural Revolution, the four counselors jointly issued a big character poster in defense of the university Party committee with the title “The Party Committee of Tsinghua is Yan&#8217;an, not Xi&#8217;an .” This move was led by Yin, and Hu just signed his name. Later on in the Cultural Revolution, Lao Yin was involved in all the important events on the campus, but Hu stayed very low key, never actively participating again. There was a clear division among the supporters and opponents of Lao Yin, but Hu had practically no opponents. Being modest, easygoing and good-natured, he won the friendship of everyone. As for looks, Lao Yin was dark and handsome, with penetrating eyes, while Hu Jintao had a fair complexion and regular features that contributed to his gentle and courteous image. As Chinese say, hard and rigid things break easily, while soft and flexible things can weather through. Likewise, Hu Jintao was able to overcome hurdles and opponents on his way and finally became the ultimate “Commander.”</p>
<p>Travels with Hu <br />During that period, to get things done I would rather follow Lao Yin, but for leisure activities I would rather follow Hu. During the Cultural Revolution, while writing big character posters and organizing struggle groups, I always stuck with Lao Yin; for traveling outside the campus to establish ties with other groups or taking sight-seeing trips, I would stick with Hu. I took two of these tie-establishing trips, one on my own, traveling from Beijing to Guangzhou and subsequently to Hainan Island , Zhanjiang , Nanning , Guilin and Shanghai ; and the other one with Hu. </p>
<p>The two of us started from Beijing , traveling to Xi&#8217;an , Chengdu and Chongqing , and then in Chongqing took a boat heading east along the Yangtze River . We rarely mentioned the Cultural Revolution on the trip, but rather immersed ourselves in the scenery: the simple classical atmosphere of Xi&#8217;an , the bustling prosperity of Chengdu , the rolling hills of Chongqing , the precipitous Three Gorges, the vast expanse of the Yangtze. Hu disembarked in Nanjing , presumably returning to his native place of Taizhou; I took off in Shanghai , also paying a visit to my home. Along the way, it was Hu who looked after me. He took the initiative in making all the arrangements, while making me feel respected, and with an attentiveness and thoroughness that made me feel comfortable all the way. </p>
<p>Hu Jintao was in the fifth class of the hydraulics department, and he should have graduated in 1965. As a political counselor, he would normally have graduated a year later than his classmates, but in his case the postponement brought him right into the Cultural Revolution period, and he did not leave Tsinghua until 1968. I remember that he was deployed to Liujiaxia , Gansu Province. Before leaving Beijing , he treated Lao Yin and me to dinner. Saying that we had to fleece him, Lao Yin picked the Jinyang Restaurant. It was the first time I had gone to a big restaurant in Beijing . </p>
<p>Jinyang had once been the library of Yuewei Cottage, home of the renowned Qing Dynasty scholar Ji Xiaolan, whose Yuewei Cottage Sketchbook I admired. The courtyard was quiet, deep and wide, with carved wooden pillars, and was considered to reflect a genuine flavor of Shanxi Province , the first such restaurant in Beijing . Here one dined among the fragrance of books. As I recall, we had a few drinks that day. The three of us could not help but sigh over the knowledge that our farewell would correspond with the Chinese saying,</p>
<p>“Tomorrow we will be separated by mountains and the vastness of world events.” </p>
<p>Indeed, this parting ultimately lasted 14 years. In 1982, while serving as a member of the Gansu Province Construction Committee, Hu was dispatched to Beijing to study in the Central Party School . At that time I was working in the computer center of Academia Sinica in Beijing . To report to the Party School , Hu took a bus from the train station. When the bus reached Huangzhuang Station, Hu made a point of stopping off to see me briefly. Later on he was assigned to work in the central office of the Youth League, and the reports and word of mouth from various circles were pretty good. For some reason, I felt personally honored. </p>
<p>Another five years passed. In 1987, private entrepreneurs in the technology industry held a meeting in Guiyang City . Stone Corp., the computer company I founded, had already won a reputation. Hu was then the Party secretary of Guizhou Province , and I made an appointment to pay him a visit at his office. The reception room was warm and simple, even more so than my office, which was already very simple for a corporate president. Hu was still modest and cautious. From our conversation, I gathered that he was on good terms with the various circles of influence in his province. This had always been his strength. Officials from the provincial science committee accompanied me during the meeting. We chatted about the planning of science and technology development and also science enterprises. When I departed, Hu insisted I take two bottles of Maotai. I had no doubt that they were the genuine stuff.</p>
<p>The Parting of Ways <br />Then came the political disturbances of 1989. After that, the trajectories of our lives spun off in two extremes, but deep in my heart, I have continued to wish him well. First I wished him a smooth power succession, and then that he could make a genuine contribution. When news broke out that he had sent people to Europe to study the development of social democracy, and that he made arrangements for the Politburo to study constitutional law when he first made it to the top, that he spoke publicly about the havoc wreaked by SARS, that he brushed aside objections to memorial activities for Hu Yaobang, he ignited a certain hope. However, his speech on the need to learn from Cuba and North Korea was extremely disappointing. </p>
<p>But these hopes and disappointments are my own problem, and nothing to do with Hu. As Zen Buddhists say, “What matters is what moves the heart, not what moves the flag.” He is still the “obedient and efficient” Hu Jintao within the Communist system. </p>
<p>Still immersed in my worldly dreams, I recently wrote three essays: “Parting with the Communist,” “Why the Communist Party is Not Yet Finished” and “Communist on the High Planes.” The first was to mourn the passing of an elder, the second to sort out my own thoughts, and the third as suggestions to those both in and out of office. Whether anyone will take any notice of them is not something that I can allow to concern me. </p>
<p>I will probably stop writing this kind of essay from now on. So many people are writing that no one will notice my absence. I would like to write about things that I want to and things that only I can write; to tell my own story. I plan to write 100 pieces regarding “My Years in Tsinghua,” 100 pieces on “The Stone Corp. Story” and 100 pieces on “Life in Exile,” just to give an account of my life. </p>
<p>After reading what I wrote recently, someone said, “Wan Runnan, it seems you have no intention to go back (to China ).” True, except for my parents who are now in their eighties, I don&#8217;t have much that concerns me there. Some time ago, my mother came down with acute pneumonia, running a fever of 39.6 ℃ . The hospital said she was in critical condition, and some faithful friends tried to arrange for my return. But I made it very clear: I would not say anything against my conscience. At this age, I want to remain true to myself. Although it ultimately did not work out, I am most grateful for the kindness of my friends, to the bottom of my heart. </p>
